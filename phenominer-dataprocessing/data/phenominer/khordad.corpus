for <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> ( graded none , once , more than once ) the recorded figures were for springer spaniel ( n = 14 ) 21% , 7% , 71 % ; 
an ongoing prospective study of bacterial infection in <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> at the buffalo veterans affairs medical center has revealed interesting features regarding the dynamics of colonization in <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> . 
influenzaecolonizes the lower respiratory tract of adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> ) and is an important cause of exacerbations of the disease . 
in addition to being a common cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> , nontypeable h . 
in order to develop strategies to treat and prevent infections caused by bacteria in biofilms , including <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> with effusion , it will be important to elucidate the characteristics of bacterial pathogens as biofilms . 
background <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> and coronary heart disease ( coronary heart disease ) are significant contributors to morbidity and mortality in developed countries . 
among other reported chronic diseases were hypo- and hyperadrenocorticism , different tumours , urolithisasis , lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> . 
influenzae grows as a biofilm in the respiratory tract of adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> , reminiscent of pseudomonas aeruginosaand its well established propensity to grow as a biofilm while causing infection in patients with cystic fibrosis . 
background the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 is a putative tumor suppressor that is downregulated in the majority of human <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancers <END> . 
these loci overlap with the genomic regions containing the genes for <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> 5 ( <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> 5 ) and limb girdle <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> 1b ( limb girdle <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> 1b ) , respectively . 
discussion management of severe left ventricular dysfunction from <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> is a challenging issue . 
during the course of this study , the gene mutated in limb girdle <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> 1b was identified as lamin a/c . 
concerning the hazardous effects of prolonged cardiopulmonary by-pass and ischemic time [13 ] on the depressed left ventricle and impaired other organ functions due to <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> , incomplete revascularization has been offered to take the advantage of a shorter extra corporeal and ischemic time [6 ,7] . 
however the primary advantage of coronary bypass surgery over percutaneous interventions is complete revascularization and adverse effects of incomplete revascularization on survival have been described particularly for patients with an <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> [8 ] . 
in the cass study , a study on patients with three-vessel disease , the nonrevascularization of at least one of the three systems was considered incomplete and the proportion of patients with incomplete revascularization was found higher in group with <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> [14 ] . 
materials and methods cell lines human tumor cell lines ls1034 <START:PHENOTYPE> colorectal carcinoma <END> ( atcc number : crl-2158 ) , sw480 <START:PHENOTYPE> colorectal adenocarcinoma <END> ( atcc number : ccl-228) , msto-211h <START:PHENOTYPE> biphasic mesothelioma <END> ( atcc number : crl-2081 ) and hepg2 <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> ( atcc number : hb-8065 ) were purchased from american type culture collection . 
conclusions in this study we showed that ifn-gamma-inducibility of major histocompatibility complex class ii antigens in weakly inducible ls1034 <START:PHENOTYPE> colorectal carcinoma <END> cell line can be rescued by concomitant incubation with protein kinase c agonists . 
horses succumbing to equine motor neuron disease or euthanized on the basis of humane considerations had a necropsy performed and the clinical diagnosis of equine motor neuron disease was confirmed by histopathological examination of the central nervous tissues for evidence of degenerations , such as glial <START:PHENOTYPE> scarring <END> in the ventral gray column and wallerian degeneration of the intramedullary portion of the somatic efferent neurons [4 ,13 ] . 
many factors were associated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels , such as age , gender , lifestyle activities , and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> . 
2 ) characterize the extent to which isolates from the middle ear fluid of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> and from the sputum of adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> form biofilms ; 
the mechanism of p27 down-regulation in <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancers <END> in unknown , but presumably involves increased proteolysis mediated by the scfskp2 ubiquitin ligase complex . 
for example , it has been reported that the mrna levels of epidermal growth factor and epidermal growth factorr are markedly increased in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> tissues in comparison with the normal pancreas , suggesting that the coexpression of epidermal growth factorr and its ligands may contribute to the <START:PHENOTYPE> aggressiveness <END> of human <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> . 
results biofilm formation by clinical isolates fifteen isolates recovered from the sputum of adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> and 15 isolates recovered from the middle ear fluid of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> were studied for biofilm formation . 
fibroblast growth factor and its receptors are also overexpressed in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> tissues and cell lines , and cell growth , cell adhesion and invasion are modulated by fibroblast growth factors in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell lines . 
here we used the human <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> cell line lncap , which undergoes g1 cell cycle arrest in response to androgen , to examine the role of the skp2 f-box protein in p27 regulation in <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> . 
igf-1 and its receptor igf1r are also overexpressed in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> , and they also have the potential to stimulate pancreatic cancer cell growth . 
we have now demonstrated that sti571 has dose-dependent inhibitory effects in all six tested <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell lines , with gi50 in the range of 17 31.5 m (1 0 % fcs ) and 9 20 m ( 1 % fcs ) . 
conclusions our studies suggest that skp2 is a major determinant of p27 levels in human <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> cells . 
likewise , mice overexpressing tropomodulin1in the heart show disrupted sarcomere organization with shortened thin filaments , leading to myofibril degeneration and <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> . 
based on our in vitro studies , we suggest that overexpression of skp2 may be one of the mechanisms that allow <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> cells to escape growth control mediated by p27. 
consequently , the skp2 pathway may be a suitable target for novel <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> therapies . 
other oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal findings other gastrointestinal anomalies , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> ( one in case with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> ) have been reported in eight patients [2 ,7 ,9 ,10 ,19 ,22,25] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> ( 2 patient ) and major <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> ( 1 patient ) . 
in the largest series of 57 cases , the frequency of <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> was 46% , suggesting that with increasing clinical experience the diagnosis can be made with and without <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> [22] . 
additionally , no significant differences concerning ischemic changes or <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> in the electrocardiography registrations or perioperative <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarctions <END> between groups were detected . 
mutations in myosin heavy chain 7 are estimated to account for 40 5 0 % of the cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> . 
it is probable that mowat-wilson syndrome is under-diagnosed in patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> and it has been well documented that this feature is not always present [4 ,5 ,7-12 ,19 ,22,24,25] . 
mutations in many proteins making up the cardiac sarcomere have been shown to cause cardiac hypertrophy:mutations in the tpm1gene , for example , cause type 3 familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> ( cmh3) , and a transgenic mouse expressing a cmh3 mutation develops ventricular myocyte disarray and hypertrophy. 
this variety in the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> in mowat-wilson syndrome may be caused by both variations in zinc finger e-box-binding homeobox 2 gene abnormalities and epigenetic factors [32 ] . 
many patients without known <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> have been noted to have severe <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> , not investigated by rectal biopsy . 
thus , sti571 maybe also inhibit <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell growth via the pdgf receptor pathway . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> was present in 97 out of 170 of the published cases ( 57% ) [ 19 ,22,24,29,31 ] . 
in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancers <END> , there is a marked increase in the mrna levels of pdgfr-alpha and pdgfr-beta in comparison with the normal pancreas , and pdgf and both pdgf receptors are present in the cancer cells . 
a milder form of <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> might not be diagnosed in infancy . 
a potentiating effect of phorbol myristate acetate has been reported in <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid carcinoma <END> cellsbut , in contrast to ls1034 cells , normal ifn-gamma response in those cells was only partially lost as a result of <START:PHENOTYPE> malignant transformation <END> . 
a significant difference in incidence of hemodyalisis , <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> and hospital mortality were also found in favor of hybrid-pump group ( table 3 ) . 
for example , the presence of epidermal growth factors , fibroblast growth factors , pdgfs , and igfs and their respective receptors has been observed in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> , and these growth factors are thought to contribute to its malignant phenotype . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> was in fact present in 19 out of 73 of the published cases without <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> ( 26% ) [ 19 ,22,29] . 
whether or not this phenomenon may be reproduced with other ifn-gamma-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> colon carcinoma <END> cell lines is of particular interest , since colonic epithelium is physiologically exposed to protein kinase c activators that enhance cytokine signalling in enterocytes during inflammatory responses within the intestinal mucosa . 
in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> , a variety of other growth factors that signal through tyrosine kinase receptors are also expressed at increased levels . 
in view of these lines of evidence suggesting that nontypeable h influenzae grows as a biofilm during human <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory tract infection <END> , the goals of the present study are to 1 ) develop an assay to study biofilms of nontypeable h . 
to date , pdgf expression has been shown in a number of different solid tumors , from <START:PHENOTYPE> glioblastomas <END> to prostate carcinomas . 
conclusion sti571 inhibits pancreatic cells growth , but these effects are not mediated through blockage of the pdgf receptor tyrosine kinase , since pdgf did not stimulate <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell growth and did not lead to map kinase or pdgf receptor phosphorylation . 
the bacterium causes <START:PHENOTYPE> acute otitis media <END> as established by pure culture of the organism from middle ear fluid during disease . 
influenzae in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> and adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> . 
sebaceous adenitis has also been described with <START:PHENOTYPE> thymoma <END> and other serious internal disease in the rabbit [4,21,22] and in dogs with leishmaniosis [ 19 ,23] . 
furunculosis and demodicosis severe enough to involve the sebaceous gland can mimic sebaceous adenitis , which is the case in feline <START:PHENOTYPE> acne <END> [20] . 
a large amount of effort has been devoted to understanding the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> with a goal toward developing ways to prevent the disease . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> acute otitis media <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> with effusion represent an enormous health problem for children worldwide . 
mutational analysis of tropomodulin 2 in <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> 5 two patients and two controls from a family with an autosomal recessive form of familial als ( <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> 5 ) were analyzed for mutations in tropomodulin 2 . 
influenzaehas been implicated as a cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> with effusion , which refers to the presence of fluid in the middle ear in the absence of acute symptoms . 
background <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> and coronary heart disease ( coronary heart disease ) have long been considered major contributors to morbidity and mortality in developed countries . 
some authors have proposed that in <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> with effusion , nontypeable h . 
these observations suggest that in <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> with effusion , bacteria are in a physiological state which differs from that of bacteria growing planktonically in a free floating phase . 
many middle ear fluids from children with <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> with effusion are sterile by culture . 
over the past decade bacteria in the form of biofilms have been recognized as important causes of a variety of human infections , including infections of prosthetic devices , <START:PHENOTYPE> endocarditis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dental caries <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> in cystic fibrosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> prostatitis <END> and others . 
combination of antegrade and retrograde cold blood cardioplegia was used to achieve <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrest <END> . 
in the present study , we demonstrate that sti571 partially but not specifically blocks epidermal growth factor , igf-1 and fibroblast growth factor-2 mitogenic pathways , which have the potential to stimulate <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell growth . 
nevertheless , in view of the extremely poor prognosis of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> , and in view of the fact that pancreatic cancer tissues in vivo indeed express both pdgf and c-kit receptor tyrosine kinases , it seems worthwhile to further investigate the therapeutic effects of sti571 in small clinical trials . 
since sti571 has relatively high gi50 concentrations in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cells , its action appears to be of toxic origin and its clinical relevance in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> is rather doubtful . 
6 ) mab against <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein protein , fitc conjugate ( <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein-fitc) , clone g3-245 , mouse igg1 ; 
age , gender , incidence of preoperative risk factors , left ventricular ejection fraction and the degree of pre-existing <START:PHENOTYPE> angina pectoris <END> were comparable between groups ( table 1 ) . 
conclusion linear <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> is an unusual cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> enophthalmos <END> , however the presence of a linear scar on the forehead "en coup de sabre " should aid the examiner in making the accurate diagnosis . 
in addition , cyclin a is frequently overexpressed in <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancers <END> . 
below , we consider possible reasons for the effectiveness of the home-cage in arresting checking , discuss whether the obtained findings reveal the phenomenological experience of a compulsion in the rat , highlight the implications of the study for an animal model of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> checking , and relate controllability of behavior to compulsive checking and <START:PHENOTYPE> stereotyped behavior <END> induced by psychostimulant drugs . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> was defined as a serum creatinine level above 2.0 mg/dl . 
cell culture and mtt assay human <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell lines were routinely grown in dmem ( colo-357 , and mia-paca-2 ) or rpmi ( aspc-1 , bxpc-3 , capan-1 , and t3m4 ) supplemented with 10 % fbs , 100 u/ml penicillin , and 100 g/ml streptomycin ( complete medium ) . 
mutations in actin or actin-binding proteins have been found to cause several human diseases , ranging from <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> to immunodefiencies such as wiskott-aldrich syndrome . 
except from german shepherd dog <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> , where a predominance for males was shown by koch & peters ( 1996 ) and by denerolle et al ( 1998 ) [24,25] , no sex predilection is seen for deep pyoderma in dogs at the authors knowledge , which could otherwise be a cause of secondary inflammation and destruction , at least clinically , of the sebaceous glands . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> was defined for the patients class iii or iv ( nyha ) . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> pruritus <END> was reported in 55 % of all dogs ( 28/51 dogs ) and 63 % of the dogs (32/51 dogs ) had been diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> at least once prior to diagnosis . 
however , also 47 % of the dogs ( 9/19 dogs ) reported to not have had <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> were pruritic . 
while our study suggests that skp2 is an important player in p27 regulation in <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> cells , recent studies have also implicated another protein , cop9/signalosome5/jab1 , in p27 regulation . 
amiodarone versus implantable cardioverter-defibrillator trial amiodarone versus implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ( amiodarone versus implantable cardioverter-defibrillator ) trial included one hundred three patients with non-ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( non-ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ) , left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 0.35 , and asymptomatic non sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> ( non sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> ) [27] . 
this indicates that sebaceous adenitis can be a primarily pruritic condition or that <START:PHENOTYPE> pruritus <END> could be due to <START:PHENOTYPE> skin infections <END> , ectoparasites or allergic conditions not diagnosed by the attending veterinarian . 
to the extent that <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> checking is an exaggerated form of normal checking regarding one 's well-being and security , and a similar relationship exists between quinpirole-induced and normal checking in the rat , then it is reasonable to suppose that the suspension of quinpirole checking emanates from a sense of 'safety ' provided by the familiar contextual cues of the home-cage . 
it has been suggested that the akita can show general signs or <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> associated with the disease [1 ,10 ,13 ] but this could not be confirmed by reichler in 2001 [12 ] . 
a similar dynamic process of a changing balance between 'safety ' and ' checking ' cues may account for the variable success that <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> patients have in resisting their compulsions . 
all implantable cardioverter defibrillator-patients were implanted with <START:PHENOTYPE> patch <END> electrodes during thoracotomy for cabg application . 
however , there have been inconsistent reports of its association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> . 
the affected horse demonstrated the typical clinical signs of progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle fasciculations <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , and wasting . 
expression levels of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein protein was measured using a procedure described elsewhere . 
background ppar plays a fundamental role in adipogenesis and insulin sensitisationand is a candidate gene for susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> type ii diabetes mellitus <END> . 
this <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> in attitude was described especially in some dogs with intermittent clinical signs (data not shown) , a finding also described by rosser 1992 [10 ] . 
cabg <START:PHENOTYPE> patch <END> trial patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> and positive signal averaged electrocardiogram undergoing cabg were randomly assigned to implantable cardioverter defibrillator versus no antiarrhythmic treatment in the cabg <START:PHENOTYPE> patch <END> trial [17 ] . 
this trial compared the safety and utility of empirical anti- <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> pacing ( anti-tachycardia pacing ) with shocks for fast <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> in patients receiving implantable cardioverter defibrillator . 
tilt table testing should not be performed in a patient who is orthostatic at baseline or who has had near-syncope without overt <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of consciousness <END> . 
painfree rx ii trial pacing fast <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> reduces shock therapies ( painfree rx ii ) trial was the largest trial reporting data on quality of life as well as the latest [33 ] . 
discussion androgen control of lncap cell proliferation we have used the cell line lncap as a model to examine the role of skp2 in androgen control of p27 expression and cell cycle progression in human <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> cells . 
of the 131 patients with fast <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> , 98 completed sf-36 both at baseline and at 1 year . 
of 634 implantable cardioverter defibrillator patients 313 were randomized to empirical anti- <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> pacing while 321 patients received shocks as the initial therapy of spontaneous fast <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> . anti-tachycardia pacing was effective in 229 of 284 episodes in the anti-tachycardia pacing arm . quality of life was measured with the sf-36 and found to be improved in patients with fast ventricular tachycardia in both arms but even more in the anti-tachycardia pacing arm . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> is common in middle-aged dogs and the disease can be both under- and over-diagnosed . 
patients with neurocardiogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> had a shorter time to <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> than normal subjects with a false positive study ; 
one study compared 8 normal with and 8 normal without a positive tilt table test and 15 patients with neurocardiogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> [32 ] . 
the mechanism for <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> during tilt table testing is different in normal and patients with a history of neurocardiogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> . 
this polymorphism has been extensively investigated for association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> . 
quality of well being schedule and the state trait <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> inventory were the instruments used for assessment in this study . 
therefore , mutations that alter the level of bone morphogenetic proteins or alter the degree of bmp signaling are candidates to contribute to axenfeld-rieger syndrome and other conditions involving anterior segment malformation , elevated intraocular pressure , and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> . 
interestingly , some bone morphogenetic proteins modulate tooth morphogenesis and axenfeld-rieger patients present with <START:PHENOTYPE> dental abnormalities <END> . 
one study demonstrated that both rare alleles were associated with an <START:PHENOTYPE> increased body weight <END> in women , and when they occurred together the overall effect was additive . 
branch 1 of the histidine triad superfamily includes the ubiquitous hint enzymes plus two enzymes with a more phylogenetically resstricted distribution , namely aprataxin , which is lost in humans with ataxia-oculomotor <START:PHENOTYPE> apraxia <END> and the scavenger mrna decapping enzyme dcps . 
10 of these patients developed asystole , often associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , requiring a brief period of cardiopulmonary resuscitation [28] . 
the springer spaniel and the akita exhibited more severe clinical scores , especially with respect to <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> , as compared to the standard poodle . 
this mechanism may also be retained in other <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancers <END> , thereby representing a potential target for intervention . 
we had previously mapped tropomodulin 2 ( tropomodulin 2 ) to the genomic region containing the gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> 5 ( <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> 5 ) . 
the canadian implantable defibrillator study ( canadian implantable defibrillator study ) canadian implantable defibrillator study [21] compared antiarrhythmic therapy versus implantable cardioverter defibrillator in patients resuscitated from <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrest <END> , and those with sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> of more than 150 beats per minute with near <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> and left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 0.35 or <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> with inducible <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> . 
note added in proof while the manuscript was under review , results of a clinical trial had been published showing that a systemic combination treatment with ifn-gamma and gm-csf for as long as 9-weeks failed to induce major histocompatibility complex class ii on tumor cells in 9 out of 15 <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> patients . 
developmental disorders of the ocular anterior segment , including axenfeld-rieger syndrome , are often associated with elevated intraocular pressure and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is usually associated with high intraocular pressure ( intraocular pressure ) that results from an increased resistance to drainage of the ocular fluid . 
background <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is a leading cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> that involves loss of retinal ganglion cells and degeneration of the optic nerve . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> ) is a common syndrome with a large genetic component . 
sequence analysis of tropomodulin 2 revealed no mutations or polymorphisms in <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> 5 patients or controls . 
thus , bmp4 is a strong candidate to contribute to axenfeld-rieger anomaly and other developmental conditions associated with human <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> . 
the abnormalities are similar to those in human patients with developmental <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> . 
maintaining the patient in an upright position for a brief duration on a tilt table has become a common means of testing for predisposition to vasovagal <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> . 
it is widely accepted that <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> and /or <START:PHENOTYPE> bradycardia <END> during upright tilt testing is equivalent to spontaneous vasovagal <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> . 
in endometrium ( latheca externa cells follicular phase notheca externa cells stromal <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> ) , lutheca externa cellsinizing hormone receptor immunoreactheca intheca externa cellsrnavity was associatheca externa cellsd with endometrial glands ( g , fimmature granulosa cells . 2h ) and with the surface epithelium of the utheca externa cellsrine cavity ( se ) . 
[30] reported <START:PHENOTYPE> glucosuria <END> in ponies with gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicosis . 
no treatment was given to three healthy horses despite periodic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> due to the research protocol in these horses . 
apart from electrolyte infusions , additional treatment for <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> was provided during anaesthesia in 17 colic horses . 
this would be in concordance with previous studies , where intranasal instillation of 1 % acetic acid was shown to induce loss of cilia and epithelium as well as submucosal <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> and inflammation within 12 h of exposure [3 ] . 
this test is not recommended for screening purpose in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> . 
however , there was one horse with <START:PHENOTYPE> rhabdomyolysis <END> and when that horse was excluded the mean urine protein/creatinine ratio was 1.22 , suggesting that no <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> indicative to tubular damage could be detected . 
results clinical observations all calves showed a varying degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory distress <END> such as coughing and/or dyspnoea from 1 week post inoculation and onward . 
exercise testing the yield of exercise testing in the diagnosis of the etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> is very low ( <1% ) . 
exercise testing is useful as an ancillary diagnostic test for evaluation of ischemic heart disease in patients with arrhythmic <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , particularly <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> . 
several animals had <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> and their general appearance was affected . 
exercise ecg is also recommended for the evaluation of symptoms with exercise and post exertional <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> . 
upright tilt testing the tilt table test ( also called the upright tilt table test ) has become a commonly performed test for the evaluation of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , particularly in young , otherwise healthy patients in whom the diagnosis of vasovagal or neurocardiogenic syncope is often entertained [11 ,25] . 
it is also useful in older persons with suspected neurally mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> [26] . 
oleic acid-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> might be caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> rather than comprised left ventricular function . 
conclusion oleic acid leads to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> which results in hemodynamic fluctuation in oleic acid-induced acute lung injury model . 
eight colic horses developed some type of <START:PHENOTYPE> gait disturbance <END> post anaesthesia but only in four horses a clinical diagnosis of post-anaesthetic <START:PHENOTYPE> myositis <END> with swollen , painful muscles was made . 
specific treatment was required in a total of eight horses , and apart from additional analgesia ( as stated above but could also include pethidine and intravenous infusions of lidocaine) , and electrolyte infusions this treatment included intravenous infusions of potassium plus 2.5 % glucose in two horses ( newly foaled , inappetent mares) , glucose only in one horse ( hyperlipaemia prophylaxis ) , and a calcium infusion in one horse ( <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcaemia <END> ) . 
the finetti software [38 ] using pearson 's goodness-of-fit chi2 was employed to test for allelic association between single single nucleotide polymorphisms and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> . 
occasional patients have a pronounced cardioinhibitory response to this test characterized by symptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bradycardia <END> , or both . in one series , 77 of 179 patients ( 43 percent ) with unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> had a positive tilt test ; 
ancova with age and body mass index as covariates were used to analyze differences in <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and blood lipid phenotypes between genotypes . 
almost half of the sample had a previous <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> and around 10 % had previous cardiac surgery . 
one of these horses developed a severe triceps <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> ( h14 ) and was also treated with flumethazone and topical ketoprofen gel , while the other horse only showed mild symptoms . 
three horses developed <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> and were treated with penicillin . 
in addition , catecholamine release immediately prior to tilt-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> is similar to spontaneous vasovagal faint . 
2 ) dysautonomic response , characterized by gradual parallel decline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure , leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of consciousness <END> .3 ) psychogenic or psychosomatic response , these patients experience <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> during tilt testing with no ascertainable alteration in heart rate , blood pressure , electroencephalographic , or transcranial blood flow patterns .4 ) postural orthostatic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> syndrome ( postural orthostatic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> syndrome ) , characterized by an increase in heart rate of at least 30 beats per minute ( or a maximum heart rate of 120 bpm ) within the first 10 minutes upright during the baseline tilt , this <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> is not associated with profound <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> . 
1 ) classical vasovagal ( or neurocardiogenic) , which is characterized by the sudden onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> with or without coexistent <START:PHENOTYPE> bradycardia <END> . 
the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and obesity-related disorders has led to major research interests in the influence of adipose tissue mass [12 ] . 
congenital malformations and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> require precocious clinical investigation with intervention of several specialists ( including neonatologists and pediatricians ) . 
prognosis is linked to the <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory difficulties <END> in the first months of life due to thoracic narrowness and possible heart defects . 
general keywords used were : asymmetry , <START:PHENOTYPE> plagiocephaly <END> , torticollis , posture , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , ( differential ) diagnosis , and screening . 
disease name mowat-wilson syndrome definition mowat-wilson syndrome ( mowat-wilson syndrome ; mim # 235730 ) is a genetic disease caused by heterozygous mutations or deletions of the zinc finger e-box-binding homeobox 2 gene gene , and characterized by typical face , moderate-to-severe <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and variable congenital malformations , including <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> genital anomalies <END> ( particularly <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> in males) , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ) and eye defects . 
disease name ellis-van creveld syndrome ( mim 225500 ) chondroectodermal dysplasia mesoectodermal dysplasia definition ellis van creveld syndrome ( ellis-van creveld syndrome ) is an autosomal recessive <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal dysplasia <END> , with inter- and intra-familial variability , characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> short ribs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short limbs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> postaxial polydactyly <END> , and dysplastic teeth and nails . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defects <END> occur in 60 % of the individuals . 
the search then focused on specific diagnoses that might cause asymmetry in infancy condition with the keywords : etiology , tumors , disorders ( related to ) vision , hearing , central nervous , or musculoskeletal system , obstetric complications , brachial plexus palsy/lesion , clinical syndromes ( grisel , sandifer ) , congenital anomalies and syndromes , <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroesophageal reflux <END> , developmental dysplasia of the hip , paroxysmal torticollis , ( birth ) trauma , and clavicle fracture . 
we adopted a field trial design in which we used the horse as its own control to assess the impact of the <START:PHENOTYPE> vitamin e deficiency <END> on the same animals and hence minimize the potential effect of other intrinsic factors . 
carotid massage in the absence of symptoms reproduction , carotid sinus <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> is likely when carotid sinus hypersensitivity is found and either 1 ) spontaneous episode are related to activities that press or stretch the carotid sinus or 2 ) patient has recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> with a negative work-up . 
association between haplotypes and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> status was evaluated by chi2 . 
these reports also make it possible that other yet unidentified areas are <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> triggers . 
although some of the sites described as focal <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> triggers are only anecdotal reports , they are important to consider in an individual patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
other clues may surface during electrophysiology study by analysis of intracardiac ecgs , especially the mechanism of onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
valuable clues can be obtained by looking at multiple temporally separated ecg strips ( conventional 12 lead ecg , holter monitor or event monitor ) from patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> which can reveal frequent unifocal or multifocal atrial ectopy initiating <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> triggered by sustained supraventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> or atrial flutter amidst atrial fibrillation . 
signal-averaged ecg finding low-amplitude signals ( late potentials ) has a sensitivity of 73 % to 89% and specificity of 89% to 100% for prediction of inducible sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> by eps [20-21] . 
this test may be useful in deciding if there is a need for electrophysiological studies for diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> when these <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> are the only concern . 
results esr genotyping results to investigate if esr1 and esr2 alleles contribute to susubcutaneouseptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , polymorphisms covering the common variation in these genes were genotyped in sample 1 , table 2 . 
in most mammalian species including the horse , uncomplicated <START:PHENOTYPE> vitamin e deficiency <END> is almost exclusively an axonal degenerative disease in the young or a pigmentary retinal disorder . 
the question of the electrophysiological mechanism of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> continues to haunt us : re-entry or automaticity ? 
summary from the above review , it is evident that strides in evolution of intrventional therapies for <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> have been extensively guided by improved understanding of pathophysiology , electrical basis , mapping and catheter technology . 
in order to have a thorough insight into the syndrome , researchers often employ oleic acid-induced acute lung injury animal model to study the role of oleic acid in the pathological process of acute <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory distress <END> syndrome [6 ] . 
studies of genotype-phenotype analysis show that facial gestalt and <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed psychomotor development <END> are constant clinical features , while the frequent and severe congenital malformations are variable . 
it is worthwhile considering these palliative approaches in patients with chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> with rapid ventricular rates where drug therapy is not tolerated or unsuccessful . 
in addition , the blood level of oleic acid is significantly elevated in patients with acute <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory distress <END> syndrome ( acute <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory distress <END> syndrome ) [2 ,3] , and the proportion of oleic acid incorporated into surfactant phospholipids also increases [4 ,5 ] . 
the facial phenotype is particularly important for the initial clinical diagnosis and provides the hallmark warranting zinc finger e-box-binding homeobox 2 gene mutational analysis , even in the absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> . 
these evidences suggest that oleic acid may play an important role in acute <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory distress <END> syndrome . 
it is recommended that patients with structural heart disease or abnormal ecg undergo electrophysiological testing if clinical assessment is suggestive of arrhythmic <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> and if noninvasive testing with holter or loop monitoring has been non-diagnostic . 
management during the neonatal period is mostly symptomatic , involving treatment of the <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory distress <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow chest <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> . 
in additional 27% , there are symptoms without concurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> [ 19 ] . 
mowat-wilson syndrome ( mowat-wilson syndrome ) is a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome characterized by a distinct facial phenotype ( <START:PHENOTYPE> high forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , large eyebrows , medially flaring and sparse in the middle part , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , deep set but <START:PHENOTYPE> large eyes <END> , large and uplifted ear lobes , with a central <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> saddle nose <END> with prominent rounded nasal tip , prominent columella , <START:PHENOTYPE> open mouth <END> , with m-shaped upper lip , frequent smiling , and a prominent but narrow and triangular <START:PHENOTYPE> pointed chin <END> ) , moderate-to-severe intellectual deficiency , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and variable congenital malformations including <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> ) , genitourinary anomalies ( in particular <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> in males) , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defects <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> and eye anomalies . 
after birth , cardinal features are <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short ribs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polydactyly <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysplastic fingernails <END> and teeth . 
prenatal abnormalities ( that may be detected by ultrasound examination ) include <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow thorax <END> , shortening of long bones , hexadactyly and cardiac defects . 
it seems probable that mowat-wilson syndrome is under-diagnosed , particularly in patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> . 
the lowest measured arterial ph during anaesthesia was 6 .97 in a surviving colic horse ( c1 ) and this was due to a combined respiratory and metabolic ( base excess : -14 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> acidosis <END> . 
at the time of admission , two patients had septic shock , one patient had cavernous sinus <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombosis <END> and one patient had multiple splenic abscesses . 
among controls and those with <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> of other causes , the incidence of carotid hypersensitivity was similar with and without the tilt table test ( 6.6 and 6.3 percent , respectively ) . 
analysis of esr single nucleotide polymorphisms and haplotypes in <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> no esr1 snp displayed significant allelic association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , but one snp , rs2813544 , was associated with obesity in analysis of homozygous subjects only , nominal p value 0.05 , table 4 . 
echocardiogram echocardiography in the absence of clinical evidence of organic heart disease generally does not reveal unexpected findings that lead to an etiology for <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> [24] . 
in permutation test , the association between rs7154455 and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> remained significant ( p value 0.0022) , whereas the result for rs3020450 became borderline significant ( p value 0.064 ) . 
in dogs with glomerular <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> the ratio is >1. 0 [27] . 
two esr2 single nucleotide polymorphisms , rs7154455 and rs302045 0 , displayed allelic association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in the joint analysis of women and men , nominal p value 0.0003 0.01 , table 4 . 
further advances in mapping , localization and ablation techniques and technology will determine the role of these foci and pave the way for curative radiofrequency ablation of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
for esr2 single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1152582 , rs1271572 and rs1269056 , allelic associations with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> were observed in women , nominal p value 0.03 0.05 , but not in joint analysis of women and men , table 4 . 
it is also important to determine whether these foci are producing <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> by themselves or merely helping sustain it . 
this was illustrated by one study of 80 patients with unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , 30 controls , and 16 patients with syncope not related to carotid sinus hypersensitivity [23] . 
both single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in women , but not in men . 
carotid massage is recommended when symptoms are suggestive of carotid sinus <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> and in elderly patients with unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> . 
esr2 snp rs4986938 was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in men only , nominal p value 0.05 . 
ellis-van creveld syndrome ( ellis-van creveld syndrome ) is a chondral and <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> short ribs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polydactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> growth retardation <END> , and ectodermal and heart defects . 
the nasal tip lengthens and becomes more depressed , the columella is more prominent , leading to the appearance of a <START:PHENOTYPE> short philtrum <END> , the nasal profile becomes convex , the face tends to elongate and the jaw is more pronounced . 
a poor response of tumor cells to ifn-gamma is in agreement with previous observations that many tumors acquire such resistance upon <START:PHENOTYPE> malignant transformation <END> , possibly important as a mechanism of tumor escape from immune surveillance . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> is sometimes present at birth , but more often develops gradually in infancy and not all children are microcephalic ( at or below 2sd below the mean ) . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> is a common but not constant feature and was present in 135 out of 166 of the published cases describing this clinical sign ( 81% ) [ 19 ,22,24,29-31 ] . 
in adolescents , the nasal tip overhangs the philtrum , the face becomes long with <START:PHENOTYPE> prognathism <END> , and a long , pointed or " chisel-shaped " chin [10 ,19 ,22] . 
these results indicate that investigated the effects of a proprietary extract of ob131 irvingia gabonensis may play an important role in the control of adipogenesis and might have further implication in in-vivo anti <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> effects that exert specific influence on the ppar gene , a known contributory factor to obesity in humans [18 ] . 
the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> may support the diagnosis of the ellis-van creveld syndrome syndrome and appears to be the main determinant of longevity [6 ,14 ] . 
the uplifted ear lobes do not change significantly with time ( with the exception of the central <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , which is less obvious in adults ) and are an excellent diagnostic clue . 
this research provides insight into an important mechanism for combating <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> . 
4 ) congenital heart malformations occurring in about 50 60 % of cases and comprising of single atrium , defects of the mitral and tricuspid valves , patent ductus , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic left heart <END> syndrome . 
the oral manifestations spectrum is wide , including <START:PHENOTYPE> malocclusion <END> , labiogingival adherences and <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hypertrophy <END> , labiogingival frenulum hypertrophy , accessory labiogingival frenula , serrated incisal margins , dental transposition , diastrema , <START:PHENOTYPE> conical teeth <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> enamel hypoplasia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypodontia <END> ( figure 3 ) . 
after birth , the cardinal features usually present are : 1 ) disproportionate <START:PHENOTYPE> small stature <END> whith increasing severity from the proximal to distal portions of the limbs , and shortening of the middle and distal phalanges ( figure 1 ) ; 
the acute phase proteins response is similar to what has been observed earlier during viral and bacterial respiratory diseases making differentiation between lungworm infection and those other <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory infections <END> not possible based solely on measurements of the acute phase proteins response . 
2 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> polydactyly <END> affecting hands ( uni [exceptional: [13] ] or , usual , bilateral ) and , occasionally , the feet ( figure 2 ) ; 
3 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> hidrotic ectodermal dysplasia <END> mainly affecting the nails , hair and teeth ; 
they are large and uplifted with a central <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> and have been described as being like " orecchiette pasta " or like " red blood corpuscles " in shape . 
thus , the <START:PHENOTYPE> stomatitis <END> may be related to the generally poor condition of the animal , but may also be related to the fact that this particular calf had a swollen liver with severe infestation of taenia hydatigena larvae . 
all testing must be tailored to the patient based on the findings of the history and physical examinations and with knowledge of the sensitivity and specificity of each test to identify the cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> . 
they include <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow thorax <END> , marked shortening of the long bones , hexadactyly of hands and feet , and cardiac defect [11 ,12 ] , leading to discussing the diagnosis of short rib-polydactyly syndromes ( cf . below ) . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyponatremia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcemia <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> is found in 2% to 3% of patients , but these appear to be patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> rather than <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> [1-4] . 
cardiovascular testing 12-lead ecg although ecg is often abnormal , causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> are rarely assigned ( <5 % of patients ) on the basis of ecg and rhythm strip [1-4] . 
one common esr2 haplotype , tccc ( frequency 29% ) at single nucleotide polymorphisms rs302045 0-rs1271572 -rs1887994-rs7159462 was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , nominal p value 0.024 , table 3 . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> bleeding <END> is generally diagnosed clinically and confirmed by a complete blood count or hemoccult tests . 
prolonged ecg monitoring it has become clear that results of ambulatory monitoring are often difficult to interpret in evaluating <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> because of the lack of a " gold standard " for diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> and the rarity of symptoms during monitoring . 
an ecg is recommended in all patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> because abnormalities found on ecg ( such as bundle branch block ) may guide further evaluation , or if a specific diagnosis is made the findings can be important in immediate decision making . 
in sample 1 , no esr1 haplotype was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , table 3 . 
rs7154455 and rs3020450 were genotyped in sample 2 where no association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> was observed , table 4 . 
nor was there any association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in analysis of pooled samples 1 and 2 ( results not shown ) . 
here , we used the androgen-sensitive human <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> cell line lncapas a model system to address the role of skp2 in androgen-mediated cell cycle control . 
in sample 1 , two esr2 single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> with nominal p value < 0.01 . 
additional suggestive facial features include <START:PHENOTYPE> telecanthus <END> , a full or <START:PHENOTYPE> everted lower lip <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> posteriorly rotated ears <END> . 
in infancy , there are <START:PHENOTYPE> excess nuchal skin <END> , a rounded skull shape , a sparse <START:PHENOTYPE> fine hair <END> and a puffy anterior neck ; 
the face is square shaped with <START:PHENOTYPE> high forehead <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthus <END> , deep set but <START:PHENOTYPE> large eyes <END> , a <START:PHENOTYPE> broad nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> saddle nose <END> with prominent rounded nasal tip , prominent columella , <START:PHENOTYPE> open mouth <END> , with m-shaped upper lip , frequent smiling , and a prominent but narrow and triangular <START:PHENOTYPE> pointed chin <END> . 
facial gestalt the clinical features of the face are very typical and the diagnosis of mowat-wilson syndrome is based on recognition of the distinctive facial gestalt , usually associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> . 
one single calf had a more widespread ulcerative <START:PHENOTYPE> stomatitis <END> . 
brief <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> are nonspecific and can be found in asymptomatic healthy individuals . 
gross lesions were noted in animal a , in which a fibrinopurulent polyserositis was seen , and in animal c , which had an exudative <START:PHENOTYPE> meningitis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> . 
even though winter inanition of reindeer must be considered balanced ( lack of both energy and protein) , it is not surprising that <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> /effusions due to hypoproteinaemia occur in late stages in some animals . 
in the absence of symptoms during monitoring , finding brief or no <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> does not exclude arrhythmic <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> . 
in animal c , the histopathological findings included suppurative <START:PHENOTYPE> meningitis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , and labyrinthitis ( fig . 1 ) . 
in approximately 79 % of patients there are no symptoms , but brief <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> are found in 13% . 
epidemiology the prevalence of mowat-wilson syndrome is currently unknown , but it seems probable that the syndrome is under-diagnosed , particularly in patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> [4 ] . 
discussion this is the first published case of herpes simplex tracheitis in the non-immunocompromised patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic lung disease <END> . 
approximately 4% of patients have symptoms concurrently with <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> , and 17 % have symptoms but no arrhythmias , thus potentially excluding arrhythmias as a cause of symptoms . 
it has however , been suggested that herpetic <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory infections <END> are commoner in patients with underlying lung disease [3 ] . 
suis exposed animal , b , a suppurative <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> was observed histologically . 
nontypeable haemophilus influenzae is an important cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> in children and <START:PHENOTYPE> lower respiratory tract infection <END> in adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> ) . 
in this case , repeated courses of steroids for <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> exacerbations and low dose maintenance prednisolone , were thought to have made the patient more susceptible to viral infections however , formal immunological tests were normal . 
in patients with high pretest probability of <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> such as brief sudden <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of consciousness <END> without prodrome , patients with abnormal ecg , or those with structural heart disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> are still of concern and further testing is needed . 
lower respiratory tract hsv infections have been reported in newborn infants , patients with burns , patients with acquired <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> syndrome ( acquired <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> syndrome ) and those who have been intubated [1 ,2 ,4-6 ] . 
additionally , absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> on monitoring does not exclude arrhythmic <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> because <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> are episodic and may not be captured during monitoring . 
ulceration of the trachea may be associated with necrotizing <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> . 
results fifteen clinical isolates from middle ear fluid of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> and 15 isolates from sputum of adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> were studied in an in vitro assay of biofilm formation . 
studies of loop monitoring show that <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> with symptoms are found in 8 % to 20% of patients . 
generalised <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> due to low protein intake is seen in extreme in the human disease called " kwashiorkor " [20] . 
specific attention should be directed toward : 1 ) characteristic and length of the episode , 2 ) patient and witnessed accounts , 3 ) patient age , 4 ) concomitant ( specially cardiac ) disease , 5 ) associated temporally related symptoms ( e.g. , neurological symptoms , angina , <START:PHENOTYPE> palpitations <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> ) ,6 ) premonitory ( prodromal ) symptoms , 7 ) symptoms on awakening ( post <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> symptoms ) , 8 ) the circumstances , situations surrounding the episode , 9 ) exercise , body position , posture , and emotional state , 10 ) number , frequency , and timing of previous syncopal episodes , 11 ) medications , and 12 ) family history . 
furthermore , our cohort of men was too small to exclude a male-specific impact of esr1 and esr2 on <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> . 
this possibility appears particularly important since the specific lack of ciita inducibility was cited as the most common basis for lack of ifn-gamma-induced major histocompatibility complex class ii expression among <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein-positive human tumor lines . 
the relevance of this mechanism to major histocompatibility complex class ii inducibility was recently supported by the evidence that phorbol myristate acetate is able to enhance ifn-gamma-dependent major histocompatibility complex class ii expression in thp-1 human <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> cells through the up-regulation of ifn-gamma receptors . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal electroencephalogram <END> ( electroencephalogram ) are described in 102 out of 139 of the published cases ( 73% ) [ 19 ,22,24,29-31] , although no particular seizure type is characteristic of the condition . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> are variable in nature , from absences to <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized seizures <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> myoclonic seizures <END> [9 ,19 ] . 
onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> usually occurs in the second year of life , but <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> may begin in the neonatal period , in infancy or in late childhood , or at over ten years of age [9 ,10 ,19 ] . 
in contrast to <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> , hemosiderosis and lipofuscinosis , the finding of subcutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> and/or increased amount of serous fluid in body cavities is not an extension of normal physiology , and we assume the <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> and body cavity effusions to be caused by hypoproteinaemia . 
in some cases , the <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> are resistant to treatment in childhood , but appear to be more easily managed in adolescents and adults [9 ] . 
its occurrence is commonly associated with age and/or severe <START:PHENOTYPE> malnutrition <END> [20] . 
brain anomalies reported so far include <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of corpus callosum <END> , which was present in 67 out of 155 of the published cases ( 43% ) [ 19 ,22,24,29-31] , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventriculomegaly <END> [ 19] , <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical atrophy <END> [6 ,20,25] , <START:PHENOTYPE> pachygyria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebellar hypoplasia <END> [30,31] , poor hippocampal formation [13 ] and frontotemporal <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia <END> with temporal dysplasia [3 ,9] . 
skeletal features a variety of radiological skeletal features may be observed , including retarded bone maturation , fusion of the hamate and capitate bones of the wrist , defect of the lateral aspect of the proximal part of the tibia ( knock-knees) , <START:PHENOTYPE> cubitus valgus <END> , hypoplastic cubitus , <START:PHENOTYPE> supernumerary carpal bone <END> centre , <START:PHENOTYPE> clinodactyly of the 5th finger <END> , fusion of the 5th and 6th metacarpals , disturbance in bone modeling of the metacarpals and/or phalanges . 
many aggressive <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancers <END> display decreased p27 protein levels in the presence of high p27 mrna , suggesting that p27 depletion may result from ectopic proteolysis . 
etiology the ellis-van creveld syndrome gene was previously localized by linkage analysis to the distal <START:PHENOTYPE> short arm <END> of chromosome 4 [25,26] , in an area proximal to other chondrodystrophias . 
3 diarrhoea , 3 <START:PHENOTYPE> peritonitis <END> , 5 toxinaemia , 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> hypocalcaemia <END> , 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> aspiration pneumonia <END> and 1 laminitis . 
an evaluation of the pulse can provide insight into the presence of a dissecting <START:PHENOTYPE> aneurysm <END> or subclavian steal . 
two esr2 single nucleotide polymorphisms , rs7154455 and rs3020450 were associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> with nominal p value < 0.01 . 
in patients with idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> orthostatic hypotension <END> , diabetes , amylodosis , and autonomic insufficiency , the blood pressure can drop over several minutes in the standing position and the heart rate may not change . 
it may indicate , however , the presence of other atherosclerotic lesions such as <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> ( cardiac cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> ) or subclavian artery occlusion ( subclavian steal-related <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> ) . 
no esr1 snp displayed allelic association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> or lipolysis . 
2 colon impactions , 8 colon displacements , 1 colon necrosis , 1 small intestine volvolus , 2 small intestine incarcerations , 4 strangulations , 3 enteritis/colitis , 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> peritonitis <END> and 1 abdominal <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> . 
the carotid impulse may reveal evidence for <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic stenosis <END> but a carotid bruit does not provide a direct cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> . 
although no esr1 snp displayed allelic association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , we cannot completely exclude an impact of esr1 alleles on female obesity since genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms failed to capture a few common haplotypes in the region of the esr1gene . 
thus , histone deacetylase inhibitors butyrate and trichostatin a can rescue major histocompatibility complex class ii-inducibility in <START:PHENOTYPE> bladder carcinoma <END> cellsand restore constitutive major histocompatibility complex class ii expression in plasmacytoma cells . 
while greater than 85 % of terminally differentiated secretory cells in normal human prostate display strong nuclear staining for p27 , all cases of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> , invasive carcinoma , and pelvic lymph node metastases studied by demarzo et al.showed down-regulation of p27. 
acute embolic <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> was also observed in animal a . 
however , since recruitment criteria for sample 2 were based on less stringent definitions of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and leanness , and included subjects with metabolic complications of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , we cannot exclude that the esr2 single nucleotide polymorphisms have a modest impact on more extreme forms of uncomplicated obesity such as in sample 1 . 
background a <START:PHENOTYPE> plethora <END> of circumstantial evidence implicates downregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase ( cyclin-dependent kinase ) inhibitor p27 in <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> . 
in sample 2 , as well as in pooled analysis of sample 1 and 2 , no association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> was observed . 
postnatal <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> is usual ( 34 out of 73 of the published cases with available information : 46% ) , but several patients have normal stature . 
when levene 's test for homogeneity of variances was significant , an anova model with separate variance estimates was used , proc mixed in sas system 9.1 system 9.1 ( sas system 9.1 system 9.1 , sas system 9.1 system 9.1 institute inc. , <START:PHENOTYPE> cary <END> , nc , usa ) . 
these include <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> , which commonly occur during wintertime , but is drawn to the extremes in the completely emaciated carcasses . 
neurologic findings and behavior mowat-wilson syndrome patients have at least moderate but usually <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> . 
however , other authors described <START:PHENOTYPE> polydactyly <END> in relatives of four unrelated ellis-van creveld syndrome families [20,21] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hypotonia <END> is frequent in the first years of life ; 
cardiovascular examination this may reveal murmurs consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic stenosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve prolapse <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tricuspid regurgitation <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> . 
renal abnormalities are found in very rare cases with agenesis , dysplasia , <START:PHENOTYPE> megaureter <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> nephrocalcinosis <END> . 
this lesion , which apparently has not been seen previously in experimental pig models of this infection , is a common sequela in porcine <START:PHENOTYPE> meningitis <END> due to spontaneous s . 
lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> nephronophthisis <END> has been reported only once , in a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> short limbs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short ribs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal teeth <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> polydactyly <END> ( considered as ellis-van creveld syndrome ) [17 ] , but this diagnosis may be discussed . 
suis <START:PHENOTYPE> meningitis <END> [1 ] . 
most patients are of <START:PHENOTYPE> slender build <END> . 
furthermore , <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> due to inner ear affection is a major characteristic in humans affected by s . 
several inconstant additional clinical findings are described , including <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , epi- and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> [3] , and thoracic wall and pulmonary malformations [16 ] . 
hematologic abnormalities have also been rarely reported : one case with dyserythropoiesis [18 ] and another associated with perinatal myeloblastic <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> [ 19 ] . 
diagnostic testing the proper diagnostic approach requires careful analysis of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> in light of all available clinical findings . 
this might explain the difference between our results and the association of esr1 and male <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> previously reported [14 ] . 
a new neurological deficit in a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> should be considered a premonitory sign for a <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebrovascular accident <END> . 
we have reported before that esr1 rs2234693 and rs9340799 are not associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in a cohort of swedish women partially overlapping with the cohort studied in this project [16 ] . 
again , the latter can be either compensated by placental hypertrophy ( normal apgars associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> fetal macrosomia <END> in maternal diabetes ; pt4a) , or uncompensated ( placental hypotrophy ) and associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> and apparent deterioration of the apgar scores ( pt4b ) . 
evidence of eisenmenger 's syndrome , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonic stenosis <END> , prosthetic valve dysfunction , <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic stenosis <END> , or a tumor flop can provide further clues for the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> . 
in animal b , <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> with s . 
an s3 gallop could indicate the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> . 
conclusions chinese children living with smokers or in coal-burning homes are at increased risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory impairment <END> . 
the presence of s4 and s3 gallops , are potential indicators of cardiac disease , which may be responsible for <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> . 
valsalva maneuver can diagnose <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy <END> clinically . 
the pt4 can be viewed as placentae exhibiting villous immaturity , either compensated by placental hypertrophy ( villous regeneration and expansion without maturation <START:PHENOTYPE> maternal diabetes <END> mellitus ; pt4a) , or uncompensated ( placental atrophy associated with villous immaturity intrauterine growth retardation ; pt4b ) with apparent consequences for the newborn . 
point mutations in conserved regions of these proteins can be expected to cause missense mutations and translational truncations that will also lead to hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> . 
the history to evaluate <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , sound clinical decisions are based on a carefully performed history with extreme attention to detail . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> index homair ( homeostasis model assessment ) was calculated as fasting serum insulin ( u/ml ) fasting plasma glucose ( mmol/l )/22.5 [26] . 
at post infection day 8 , the remaining one piglet showed nervous symptoms such as locomotoric <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and paresis . 
since it is clearly impractical to wait to monitor all episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> in order to arrive at a diagnosis with the present technology , clinicians must base their decisions on historical features with the presumption that the description of the episode is accurate , complete , and based on common sense [13-15 ] . 
in some families , abnormal anterior segment development contributes to <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> . 
case 4 a 55 -year-old pakistani female with metastatic <START:PHENOTYPE> melanoma <END> underwent branding with a metal rod heated over coal to multiple sites of cutaneous metastases including the right ear , angle of the mandible , middle of the neck and left axillary area ( figure 2 ) . 
background <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is a blinding disease usually associated with high intraocular pressure ( intraocular pressure ) . 
the patient partially responded to intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics ( amoxicillin with clavulanic acid and ceftriaxone ) and local wound management , but suffered permanent <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> . 
conclusion investigated the effects of a proprietary extract of ob131 irvingia gabonensis may play an important multifaceted role in the control of adipogenesis and have further implications in in-vivo anti <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> effects by targeting the ppar gamma gene , a known contributory factor to <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in humans . 
discussion a previous study was performed utilizing a swedish insurance database to estimate the incidence of and risk factors for canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> [15 ] . 
the fact that he had acute exudative wounds after branding and had no prior history of ear or sinus infections points towards branding as a cause of cavernous sinus <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombosis <END> . 
we tested the importance of bmp4 gene dosage for ocular development and developmental <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> . 
however , he was already on treatment for open angled <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and had no previous infection . 
acute <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> can sometimes present with cavernous sinus thrombosis ; 
the genes causing anterior segment dysgenesis and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> in most of these families are not identified and the affected developmental processes are poorly understood . 
mutations in the limbin gene , a bovine orthologue of ellis-van creveld syndrome2 , are associated with bovine chondrodysplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> [28] . 
microscopic examination revealed two cases of mild to moderate multifocal non-purulent chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> interstitial nephritis <END> , which we considered incidental findings without clinical significance . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> is a condition in which adipocytes accumulate a large amount of fat and become enlarged . 
the purpose of the current analysis was to validate the diagnosis of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> in the insurance database against medical records . 
three days later she presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> . 
this type is characterized by minimal <START:PHENOTYPE> bowing of the long bones <END> and severe metaphyseal changes of the femora with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic femoral neck <END> present at birth . 
logistic regression analysis predicting mental component summary scale status the four separate logistic regressions identified the following variables as significant unique predictors of non-improvement : previous cardiac surgery , previous <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> , lower cardiac rehabilitation attendance , manual occupation , higher ( poorer ) scores on profile of mood states depression-dejection , and higher ( poorer ) scores on everyday functioning questionnaire concentration . 
background endeavors to manage <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> have been heavily reliant on controlling energy intake and expenditure equilibrium , but have failed to curtail the overweight and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> epidemic . 
all dogs in the study were originally coded with canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> in the insurance database . 
for the medical variables , a greater likelihood of being in the non-improver group was the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> ( p < .10 ) , having off-pump surgery ( p < .10 ) , having had previous cardiac surgery ( p < .001 ) , having a previous <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> ( p < .10 ) , and non-attendance at cardiac rehabilitation ( p < .05 ) . 
for the physical component summary scale , factors that were significantly associated with a greater likelihood of being a member of group 2 ( non-improvers ) were : non-participation in the workforce , lower profile of mood states vigor-activity scores , higher new york heart association dyspnoea class , experiencing a new <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrhythmia <END> during or following the operation , and higher pulmonary pressure recorded during the procedure bivariate screening predicting mental component summary scale status the screening process found that there were significant bivariate predictors of mental component summary scale group status from all four categories of variables . 
from post infection day 2 , twelve out of 18 animals showed <START:PHENOTYPE> pyrexia <END> up to 42 c , which persisted throughout the observation period . 
some pigs developed inappetence , <START:PHENOTYPE> apathy <END> and mild diarrhoea from post infection day 1 . 
starting from post infection day 3 , three animals showed staggering , shivering and <START:PHENOTYPE> incoordination <END> . 
logistic regression analysis predicting physical component summary scale status when the seven medical variables were included in a logistic regression to predict physical component summary scale group , three ( higher new york heart association dyspnoea class , new <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrhythmia <END> , and higher mean pulmonary pressure ) were significant unique predictors of non-improver membership . 
discussion the morphological and immunohistochemical features of the tumour supported a diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumour ( gastrointestinal stromal tumour ) of the <START:PHENOTYPE> leiomyosarcoma <END> subset [8-11 ] . 
197 of the obese subjects in sample 2 had <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , 116 type 2 diabetes , and 50 dyslipidemia according to self report . 
some cases of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> result from mutations in the gene for paraplegin , a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial metalloprotease , including : a 2 bp deletion at position 784 , which causes a frameshift that eliminates 60 % of the protein ; 
no other clinical signs were recorded in the group infected with the avirulent classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus strain . 
hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ( hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> ) , a class ii assembly disorder , is characterized by progressive , usually severe , lower extremity <START:PHENOTYPE> spasticity <END> due to degeneration of the long axons of the central nervous system ( while the cell bodies remain intact ) . 
this other half of iron homeostasis could also easily have a role in friedreich 's <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and x-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> sideroblastic anemia <END> . 
his past medical history was insignificant except for <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> . 
no experimental structural data are available , but discrete state-space models ( h . he , g . mcallister and t .f . smith , manuscript in preparation ) for membrane proteins clearly indicate that the mutation <START:PHENOTYPE> falls <END> in an extracellular tight turn between transmembrane helices five and six . 
a missense mutation in abcb7 ( or habc7 the human homolog of atm1p ) , ile400 met , has been implicated in x-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> sideroblastic anemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , a disorder closely related to friedreich 's <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> . 
four days later , he presented to the hospital with blurry vision in the right eye and <START:PHENOTYPE> cellulitis <END> over the right temporal region . 
fundoscopy showed <START:PHENOTYPE> papilledema <END> and hemorrhages with engorgement of veins . 
the age at debut of clinical signs associated with canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> ranged from 3 to 48 months with a mean of 17 and median of 12 months , among the 52 dogs with no response to diet testing from which this information was available . 
case 3 a 60-year-old pakistani male with a history of acute exacerbation of open angled <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> of the right eye underwent branding of the right temple and vertex by a faith healer . 
they are characterized by hypoplastic thorax due to <START:PHENOTYPE> short ribs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> short limbs <END> , frequent <START:PHENOTYPE> polydactyly <END> and visceral abnormalities , and are discussed prenatally . 
he had no prior history of sinus <START:PHENOTYPE> headaches <END> or ear infections . 
these were later diagnosed to have subacute to chronic diffuse granulomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> due to lung nematodes . 
since local infection is the major reason for cavernous sinus <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombosis <END> ( cavernous sinus <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombosis <END> ) , the diagnosis was suspected in our patient as the typical sequelae had started after branding . 
[7 ] indicated that adiponectin has emerged most recently as an important adipocytokine with insulin-sensitizing effects and represents a novel treatment target for <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and type 2 diabetes . 
for the medical variables , a greater likelihood of being in the non-improver group was the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> ( p < .10 ) , having chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> ( p < .05 ) , higher b <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> ( p < .10 ) , having a previous myocardial infarction ( p < .05 ) , higher new york heart association functional status ( p < .001 ) , having <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrhythmia <END> after surgery ( p < .05 ) , and higher pulmonary pressure recorded during surgery ( p < .05 ) . 
[6 ] indicated that high circulating levels of adiponectin might be protective against the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> . 
in experiment ii ( moderately virulent virus ) the first febrile reactions were noticed in two pigs at post infection day 2 and half of the inoculated animals successively developed <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , up to 41 .5 c during the observation period . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> apathy <END> and inappetence were recorded at post infection day 11 . 
99 women in sample 3 who met the criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in sample 1 were included in both samples . 
obese subjects were recruited from an outpatient center for treatment of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> or through local advertisement . 
skin haemorrhages and <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> appeared one day before death , on post infection days 9 and 13 . 
however the clinical signs reported by the owner may not be attributed to rebound <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> . 
the second <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemic episode <END> observed in the hospital may have been partially instituted by rebound <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> when intravenous glucose therapy was discontinued . 
on two separate occasions blood samples confirming <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> was obtained , and there was an almost immediate remission of clinical signs following intravenous infusion of glucose . 
a <START:PHENOTYPE> mild hypertriglyceridemia <END> was also found indicating a catabolic state possibly caused by reduced feed intake , stress and the metabolic demand of the tumour . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> liver failure <END> may induce <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> [14 ] , and hyperbiliruninaemia was diagnosed in this horse . 
six month follow-up was available only in the one patient who recovered with no further episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic encephalopathy <END> , whereas the patient with unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> was lost to follow-up . 
two patients died in hospital , one patient developed permanent unilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> and one patient fully recovered during his hospital stay . 
a major complication of skin branding was local infection , which resulted in septic shock and was observed in two patients during the second week following branding , and cavernous sinus <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombosis <END> and splenic abscesses were seen in the first and third weeks . 
disproportionate <START:PHENOTYPE> dwarfism <END> , heart defect and <START:PHENOTYPE> thoracic dysplasia <END> are not present in this autosomal dominant condition . 
alternatively , by assuming that all dogs in group 3 were canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> negative , the number re-classified as truly atopic would have been conservatively estimated to 137 individuals (40 .9% ) . 
ellis-van creveld syndrome and mckusick-kaufman syndrome ( mckusick-kaufman syndrome , mim 236700) , both recessively inherited disorders , share <START:PHENOTYPE> postaxial polydactyly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> . 
if groups 1 to 5 were all considered canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> positive , a liberal 282 individuals ( 84.2% ) would be re-classified as atopic . 
there are no specific constant features to confirm the diagnosis of presumptive ellis-van creveld syndrome but some features , including <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> , supernumerary digits and <START:PHENOTYPE> ectodermal dysplasia <END> will mostly support the diagnosis of ellis-van creveld syndrome syndrome than jeune dystrophy. 
descriptive statistics all 335 dogs included in the analysis were coded with canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> as the diagnosis in the insurance database . 
among the canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> and/or adverse food reactions dogs ( groups 2 and 7) , 30 (55 .6% ) were males and 24 ( 44.4% ) females . 
the described clinical signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> confusion <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> , excessive <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , paresis , and muscular <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculation <END> have previously been observed during <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> in equines [3 ,14 ] . 
gastrointestinal stromal tumour and <START:PHENOTYPE> leiomyosarcomas <END> in the horse are rare occurrences [12 ] , but abdominal leiomyomas and leiomyosarcoma have been reported to cause colic , and successful surgical removal has been described [13 ] . 
it is reasonable to assume that the neurological clinical signs reported by the owner as well as those observed at the university clinic were caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> , and the hypoglycemia may thus be termed recurrent . 
however , we were unable to examine potential interactions between family history and environmental tobacco smoke in relation to atopic illness in our population because , consistent with previously published data on chinese children [37 ,38 ] , the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> ( 3.2% ) and hay <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> ( 1.8% ) was very low . 
for example , parental atopy was found to modify the effects of environmental tobacco smoke on bronchial obstruction and <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> considerably in a norwegian birth cohort study [36 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> increased nuchal translucency <END> thickness has been described associated with ecv [12 ] . 
the association of several structural fetal defects in the late first trimester , including <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow thorax <END> , short and <START:PHENOTYPE> bowed long bones <END> , rounded metaphyses , <START:PHENOTYPE> postaxial polydactyly <END> , and cardiac defect may suggest the diagnosis ecv . 
as already described for leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> , leigh syndrome and hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> , the causative mutations are not necessarily confined to a single protein-coding gene , or even to the nuclear versus the mitochondrial genome . 
it is important to notice , however , that the association of <START:PHENOTYPE> growth hormone deficiency <END> and ecv has been reported in one patient and , in this case , the growth hormone treatment had a favorable effect on growth [36 ] . 
in infancy and early adulthood , general and specialized pediatric follow-up are also required : the <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> is considered resulting of chondrodysplasia of the legs and the possible treatment with growth hormone is considered ineffective . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> neonatal teeth <END> should be removed because they may impair the feeding . 
sickle-cell <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> provides the classic example . 
symptomatic management is mostly required in the neonatal period , including treatment of the <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory distress <END> due both to <START:PHENOTYPE> narrow chest <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> . 
results study population in the insurance database , a total of 373 individuals had at least one reimbursed claim for canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> during 2002 . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> may have contributed to the clinical signs , but was in our opinion not severe enough to explain all the clinical findings . 
the digoxigenin-labelled riboprobe was synthesised from a hindiii-bamhi fragment of an infectious cdna clone of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus riems cloned into pbluescript ii sk + ( stratagene , la jolla , ca ) . 
these findings are consistent with two recent studies that have also found higher pre-operative <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> scores to predict lower health related quality of life six months after surgery [24,56 ] . 
in two european studies , domestic coal burning has been associated with lower risk for childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and allergic diseases [26,27] . 
he was also <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> and appeared mildly depressed . 
clinical presentation on initial examination at the norwegian school of veterinary science the horse was in poor body condition with general <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle wasting <END> and had a potbellied appearance . 
further , it has been found that <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive deficits <END> after coronary artery bypass graft surgery are associated with less ability to engage in activities of daily living , higher <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , more self-reported mental difficulties and greater symptom limitations [23] which result in poorer health related quality of life outcomes . 
during the 3 weeks prior to admission the horse had a history of several episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , apparent <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> , headshaking , profuse <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> at the hindquarters , collapse and clinical signs of colic . 
the majority of the diagnosed <START:PHENOTYPE> asthmatics <END> ( 76 .4% ) lived in urban areas , where prevalence of coal use was lower than in non-urban areas . 
main histopathological findings in groups 1 and 3 were the lesions in the liver , characterised by a severe active fibrosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> bile duct proliferation <END> , haemosiderosis and mild necroses . 
the diagnostic ascertainment of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> most likely was greater in the urban than in the rural areas . 
this report describes a horse with a gastrointestinal stromal tumour and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> has not previously been described in association with gastrointestinal stromal tumours in this species . 
although wheezing is often closely related to <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , coal use was not positively associated with asthma diagnosis (data not shown ) in this population . 
in group 3 , the skin showed an atrophic dermatosis , while in group 2 a crusty <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> caused by candida spp . 
mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalo <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> ( mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy ) is characterized by ptosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> , gastrointestinal dismotility , thin body habitus , <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral neuropathy <END> , myopathy , <START:PHENOTYPE> leukoencephalopathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lactic acidosis <END> and multiple mitochondrial dna deletions or mitochondrial dna depletion , or both . 
the following eight hours the horse stood quietly , uninterested in the surroundings , had <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle fasciculation <END> but was able to drink water . 
these include tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( tnf- ) , interleukin-1 beta ( il-1 ) , ionizing and ultraviolet radiation , anti-cancer drugs , growth-factor withdrawal , infection by human <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> virus ( human <START:PHENOTYPE> immunodeficiency <END> virus ) or bacteria . 
the degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> worsened again , the horse was unresponsive to visual stimuli and in the end the horse fell and could not rise again . 
an arterial blood sample obtained when the horse was laterally recumbent revealed hypoxemia ( oxygen 9.7 kpa ; reference range , 9.8 14 .6 kpa) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemia <END> ( potassium 3.1 mmol/l ; reference range , 3.3 4.5 mmol/l) , hyperchloremia ( chlorine 105 mmol/l ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> ( glucose 1 .1 mmol/l ) . 
presumably patients who experience dyspnoea are more likely to have <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> and breathlessness , and are restricted in home , social or leisure activities [55 ] resulting in lower health related quality of life . 
the response rate in the current study can be considered very good and information was available for 89.8 % of the individuals that were diagnosed with canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> and reimbursed for the cost of this during 2002 . 
an arterial blood sample was obtained and analysed within 10 minutes , which identified <START:PHENOTYPE> hypernatremia <END> ( sodium ; 141 mmol/l ; reference range , 135 139 mmol/l) , hyperchloremia ( chloride 107 mmol/l ; reference range , 92 102 mmol/l) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> ( glucose 3.8 mmol/l ; reference range , 4.6 7.3 mmol/l ) . 
(2004 ) the correctness of the diagnosis canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> was acceptable , but the completeness questionable in the investigated insurance database . 
also , the veterinarians did not know what specific diagnosis was being investigated and hence should not be any less likely to submit " dubious " canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> cases . 
a highly arched palate is often present , possibly secondary to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotonia <END> [9 ] . 
however , it appears that many practitioners diagnose canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> without ruling out adverse food reactions hence for a large group of dogs it could not be determined whether or not they were truly atopic . 
submucous cleft , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft soft palate <END> , cleft hard palate , and bilateral <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip and palate <END> have been described by some authors [1 ,3 ,9 ,10 ,20,22,25] . 
five patients have been reported with a rare , unusual <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary artery sling <END> , two of whom also had <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheal stenosis <END> / <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia <END> [18 ,19 ,25] . 
the fact that this was the first presentation with <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic encephalopathy <END> after branding , and pan sensitive e . 
coli grew both from the branding inflicted skin wounds and ascitic fluid , points towards skin wounds inflicted by branding as the likely culprit for bacterial <START:PHENOTYPE> peritonitis <END> and decompensated <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> . 
in 2007 , dastot-le moal suggested that <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary artery sling <END> with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheal stenosis <END> may be a particular association of mowat-wilson syndrome and should prompt the clinician to consider this diagnosis [22] . 
another patient had <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheal stenosis <END> with aortic valvular stenosis [22] . 
past medical history was noncontributory except for an intermittent <START:PHENOTYPE> low-grade fever <END> and occasional spikes of a high-grade <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> with chills . 
a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> velopharyngeal insufficiency <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> laryngomalacia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> glossoptosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> micrognathia <END> , as opposed to a <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent chin <END> has been described [ 19 ] . 
the wide spectrum of heart defects observed include <START:PHENOTYPE> patent ductus arteriosus <END> ( 16 patients) , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary stenosis <END> ( 12 patients ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular septal defect <END> ( 12 patients) , which are the most common , <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> ( 8 patients) , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary artery sling <END> ( 6 patients) , <START:PHENOTYPE> tetralogy of fallot <END> ( 5 patients) , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary atresia <END> ( 1 patient ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis <END> ( 1 patient ) , missing pulmonary artery ( 1 patient ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic coarctation <END> ( 4 patients) , <START:PHENOTYPE> bicuspid aortic valve <END> ( 1 patient ) , interrupted aortic arch ( 1 patient ) , mitral prolapse ( 1 patient ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic valve stenosis <END> ( 1 patient ) [1 ,5 ,7-14 ,17- 19 ,22,25] . 
case 2 a 35-year-old pakistani male with a history of chronic malaria , progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> and a complaint of severe left sided <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> was treated by branding with a hot metal rod 7 days prior to admission . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> was demonstrated in 87 out of 167 (52% ) of the published cases [ 19 ,22,24,29-31 ] . 
it is characterized by progressive gait and <START:PHENOTYPE> limb ataxia <END> , lack of tendon reflexes , <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and pyramidal <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> in inferior limbs . 
the horse became responsive to the environment and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle fasciculations <END> were not observed following the onset infusion . 
although 7.1 % of the students reported wheezing without colds , doctor-diagnosed <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> was relatively uncommon in this population ( 3.2% ) . 
iron-storage disorders friedreich 's <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> also <START:PHENOTYPE> falls <END> into the category of a class ii mitochondrial dna damage /repair disorder . 
however , it has been argued that neuropsychological test batteries that are often used in these studies may be too insensitive to measure small but personally , significant <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive decline <END> and that self-reported data may be of more value [59 ] . 
these samples identified <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> ( albumin 25 mg/dl ; reference range , 28 37 mg/dl) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperbilirubinemia <END> ( total bilirubin 169 mol/l ; reference range , 6 32 mol/l) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> ( triglycerids 1. 0 mmol/l ; reference range , 0.1 0.5 mmol/l) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperglycemia <END> ( glucose 10.4 mmol/l ; reference range , 4.2 6.4 mmol/l) , <START:PHENOTYPE> leukocytosis <END> ( leukocytes 13.1 109/l ; reference range , 5.5 12.0 109/l) , <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> ( erythrocytes 4.45 1012 /l ; reference range , 6.5 11 .5 1012 /l) , neutrophilia ( neutrophils 12.0 109/l ; reference range , 2.1 6. 0 109/l ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphopenia <END> ( lymphocytes 0.9 109/l ; reference range , 1.7 5. 0 109/l ) . 
genitourinary urogenital/ <START:PHENOTYPE> renal anomalies <END> were demonstrated in 81 out of 156 of the published cases ( 51% ) [ 19 ,22,24,29-31 ] . 
in 63 out of 100 males with mowat-wilson syndrome for whom this information was available , 58 had <START:PHENOTYPE> genital anomalies <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> was present in 33/63 patients (52% ) . 
the authors are under the impression that the incidence of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> will be under-estimated in the insured population both because the cost of veterinary care for dermatology complaints may not exceed the deductible and because the ability of veterinarians to correctly diagnose the disease varies greatly . 
this frequency is high for a single anomaly within a multiple congenital anomalies/ <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> syndrome , where clinical signs can be variably present . 
low-cost treatments will often not be recorded in the insurance database because of the size of the deductible , and this will contribute to an under-estimation of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> among patients that do not undergo expensive procedures such as intradermal testing for allergen identification or allergen specific immunotherapy . 
( figure 3 ) discussion over the past few decades , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> has become a global epidemic in both developed and developing countries . 
it is characterized by an <START:PHENOTYPE> increased adipose tissue <END> mass and is associated with high health risk [1 ] . 
most individuals are of <START:PHENOTYPE> slender build <END> . 
because of the lack of studies it is difficult to determine the threshold values for urine enzymes which in turn makes it difficult to decide whether there is a thread of <START:PHENOTYPE> renal insufficiency <END> that needs to be addressed or transient or reversible kidney damage that does not affect the prognosis of the animal . 
other genitourinary anomalies in children with mowat-wilson syndrome included duplex kidney ( 1 patient ) [1] , <START:PHENOTYPE> pelvic kidney <END> ( 1 patient ) [9] , <START:PHENOTYPE> vesicoureteric reflux <END> (1 0 patients ) [7 ,9 ,10 ,13 ,19 ,22,24] and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> ( 8 patients ) [7 ,10 ,12 ,13 ,18 ,19 ] . 
at the time of admission , two patients presented with septic shock , one patient presented with a cavernous sinus <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombosis <END> and another presented with multiple splenic abscesses . 
this could be due to reduced renal blood flow because of endotoxemia , or/and nsaid administration and a failure to correct <START:PHENOTYPE> dehydration <END> , because urine enzyme activity was only moderately increased . 
only one female with mowat-wilson syndrome had <START:PHENOTYPE> genital anomalies <END> , consisting of a vaginal septum [25] . 
on examination all were clearly unwell and were found to have various medical conditions such as chronic liver disease , chronic malaria , acute <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> and metastatic <START:PHENOTYPE> melanoma <END> . 
eight out of 63 males with genitalia anomalies , have both <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> [5 ,7 ,9 ,12 ,16-20,24,25,32 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> was described in 36 % of patients ( 23/63 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid scrotum <END> and webbed penis were identified in 3 out of 63 cases , and micro-phallus in 1 patient . 
from the analysis of eurocat data , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> affects about 3 per 1000 male births [33 ] . 
one week later , he presented with altered mental status , high grade <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> and multiple round circumscribed erythematous and indurated lesions on his abdomen ranging in size from 3 to 5 cm with black eschar and active drainage . 
samples were incubated for 30 min with constant <START:PHENOTYPE> agitation <END> at 25 c and then the crosslinking reactions terminated by the addition of 50 l of 1 m ammonium acetate per ml reaction mixture . 
ultrasound of the abdomen showed massive free fluid with <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> and a shrunken liver . 
the present study demonstrated that physical component summary scale group membership was adversely affected by surgical variables such as experiencing a new <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrhythmia <END> and the recording of higher pulmonary blood pressure during surgery . mental component summary scale group membership was not significantly associated with any of these variables in the final logistic regression . 
some segments of the small intestines showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperperistalsis <END> with increased amounts of fluids within the lumen . 
mutations in <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> / <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> peptide 1 (deafness/ <START:PHENOTYPE> dystonia <END> peptide 1 ) lead to deafness-dystonia . 
the following features have been reported in at least one affected subject : <START:PHENOTYPE> wormian bones <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus carinatum <END> , superior <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus carinatum <END> /inferior <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus excavatum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> genu valgus <END> , recurrent non-traumatic <START:PHENOTYPE> patellar dislocation <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures <END> of the hip , elbows and knees , <START:PHENOTYPE> ulnar deviation of the hands <END> , radial deviation of the thumbs , short <START:PHENOTYPE> broad thumbs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> proximally placed thumbs <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> adducted thumbs <END> ( positional) , 1st 2nd <START:PHENOTYPE> finger syndactyly <END> , distal phalanges of fingers <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia <END> , camptodactyly , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed bone age <END> , broad halluces , <START:PHENOTYPE> long halluces <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hallux valgus <END> , unilateral duplication of the hallux , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia <END> of halluces , hypertrophic first ray of the feet , middle and distal phalanges hypoplasia of toes , brachytelephalangia , overriding of the 2nd toe over the 1st and 3rd toes [1-3,6 ,9-11 ,16 , 19 ,20,22,34 ] . 
in childhood they are described as having slender and <START:PHENOTYPE> tapering fingers <END> , sometimes with <START:PHENOTYPE> prominent fingertip pads <END> , with prominence of the interphalangeal joints developing in later childhood , adolescence and adulthood [9 ,12 ,19 ,34 ] . 
the feet have been described as having <START:PHENOTYPE> pes planus <END> , mild <START:PHENOTYPE> calcaneovalgus deformity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> long toes <END> [9 ,12 ,19 ,34 ] . 
for example , more than 600 low density lipoprotein ( low density lipoprotein ) receptor mutations underlie familial <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> type , but no single low density lipoprotein receptor single nucleotide polymorphism has been associated with variation of plasma lipoproteins in the general population . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> decreased pulmonary function <END> has been associated with exposure to particulate matter and so2 in several air pollution studies during the past decades [21] . 
if all dogs classified as " questionable atopic " in the current study were diet-tested without response , an optimistic estimate would be that 84.2% of the reimbursed cases could be re-classified as canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> positive . 
although residential coal burning has been linked to <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased pulmonary function <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> among children [23-25] , conflicting data exist . 
also , the 38 animals re-classified as having " allergic <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> " could potentially have been re-classified as canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> positive had they gone through a full work-up . 
different mechanisms exist between special monogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlipidemia <END> and general population . 
the most conservative estimate would be based on the assumption that these dogs all went into complete remission on the elimination diet and hence only 40 .9% of the cases could be re-classified as canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> positive . 
these cysts and fistulae usually present as swelling or draining sinuses .13 the respiratory epithelium may be found in a <START:PHENOTYPE> teratoma <END> located in the skin.1 0 ectopic respiratory epithelium occurring as a superficial lesion in the skin has been reported only twice . 
a possible explanation for the lack of definitive morphological markers for basal cell naevus syndrome odontogenic keratocysts may relate to their aetiology : it has been observed that genetic abnormalities ( mutations and loss of heterozygosity ) of common tumour suppressor genes , including the drosophila-homologous patched gene ( patched gene ) are associated with the basal cell naevus syndrome ( as well as some other epithelial tumours , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> ) . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> in 30 patients , <START:PHENOTYPE> angina pectoris <END> in 22 patient and both in remaining . 
mahler et al13 reported <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital deafness <END> and harelip in their patient . 
to our knowlegde , this case is the first that combines <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopic respiratory mucosa <END> and skeletal malformation and <START:PHENOTYPE> polydactyly <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic heart <END> syndromes in infancy have been associated with an unusual obliterative coronary endarteritis . 
only one case was revealed amont the 16 autopsies performed over the past ten years at the johns hopkins hospital on infants with the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic right heart <END> syndrome . 
methods tayside diabetic population in tayside , scotland detailed clinical information on all individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> is recorded on an electronic clinical information system known as diabetes audit and research in tayside scotland ( diabetes audit and research in tayside scotland ) which has been described elsewhere . 
although classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> has been known for more than 150 years , the losses to this disease are still extremely high . 
the causative agent is classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus ( classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus ) , a small enveloped , positive-stranded rna virus that belongs to the genus pestivirus in the flaviviridae family [1 ,2 ] . 
this study also documented that patients receiving more than 5 shocks had a higher <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> level . 
a number of observations show that antigenic variations exist among classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus strains and the various field isolates can vary considerably in virulence . 
for example the 1997 98 outbreaks of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> caused very heavy losses in the netherlands , when approximately 12 million pigs were lost due to the disease ( about 700,000 heads ) , culling and welfare reasons [3 ] . 
the delayed diagnosis may cause uncontrolled spread of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> and heavy losses in large swine populations . 
these changes in the clinical manifestation of the disease frequently complicate the early detection and proper diagnosis of the classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , considering that the very mild clinical symptoms might easily be overlooked . 
in the last three-four decades , the most common clinical picture of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> has changed from acute to subacute , chronic or inapparent forms [4 ,5 ] . 
in addition to the similar irido-corneal angle phenotypes , both foxc1 and foxc2 hetero-zygotes exhibited comparable <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplastic iris <END> development with abnormally thin iris stroma and iris pigment epithelium . 
the principal finding of this analysis is that a single , casual determination of pulse pressure , a readily obtainable correlate of pulsatile hemodynamic load , measured 3 to 16 days after <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> , was a powerful and independent predictor of adverse cardiovascular events in a large population of post-myocardial infarction patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> . 
the following covariates were considered as potential confounders or modifying factors within the logistic models : child 's gender , presence of animals in the household , presence of pests ( cockroaches , ants , rodents) , crowding in the household , presence of older siblings , parental <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , physical activity , living area ( school district ) , and time spent indoors and outdoors . 
the results of valve replacement in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic stenosis <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> have not been defined , and its effects on left ventricular function are not known;8 10 , 11 therefore , there prolonged somatosensoryis uncertainty about the role of surgery in such patients.8 12 we have evaluated the effects of aortic valve replacement on the long-term survival , functional class and left ventricular function in patients with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic stenosis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> who were in clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> . 
based on these observations it is reasonable to believe that this type of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphenylalaninemia <END> in many cases is due to a <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced phenylalanine hydroxylase activity <END> , which is approximately 5 % of normal [12 ] . 
there were strong univariate associations between increased pulse pressure and total mortality , cardiovascular mortality , and recurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> . 
background the implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( implantable cardioverter defibrillator ) is a life saving device for individuals with life threatening ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> . 
a multivariate analysis , which included an extensive list of factors thought or known to contribute to outcome after <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> , confirmed the independent prognostic implications of increased pulse pressure on total mortality and recurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> . 
the diagnosis can be complicated by the uncharacteristic profiles of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> clinical symptoms , which may lead to delayed identification of new outbreaks ( see world organisation for animal health , oie , ) . 
in this regard , it is interesting that lipodystrophic animals and humans are characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> [ 19 ] and a recent report suggests that lipodystrophic humans have an increased lean body mass [20] , a feature displayed by male dgat1-deficient mice in the current work . 
this did not result in impaired glucose disposal in a strain of mice that was able to respond with <START:PHENOTYPE> increased adipose tissue <END> fat stores [18 ] , but did cause <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> in a strain that was unable to accommodate extra lipid in adipocytes [10 ] . 
a further diagnostic problem is that rather poor information is available concerning the pathogenicity and invasion capacity of various virulence variants of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus . 
the antiarrhythmics versus implantable defibrillator ( antiarrhythmics versus implantable defibrillators ) trial antiarrhythmics versus implantable defibrillators trial [1 ] compared antiarrhythmic drug therapy with implantable cardioverter defibrillator in survivors of <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrest <END> and those with sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , or hemodynamically unstable sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> with ejection fraction < or = 40% . 
the aim of this study was : i ) to gain further knowledge on the tissue distribution and pathogenicity of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus , by directly comparing the in vivo effects of three virulence variants of the virus ; 
hypoketotic <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycaemia <END> is a characteristic feature of fatty acid oxidation ( fatty acid oxidation ) defects . 
in addition , hepatic glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate were significantly reduced , especially during <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycaemia <END> . 
significant improvement in the postoperative course such as shorter mechanical ventilation , less catecholamines and iabp usage , less icu and hospital stay , less <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> , less need for hemodyalisis and most importantly less hospital mortality was observed in hybrid-pump group . 
to study hepatic glucose production in fatty acid oxidation defects , we used the knockout mouse model of very long-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase ( very long-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase ) deficiency presenting with stress-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycaemia <END> . 
patients with herpes infection of the respiratory tract may develop severe airway obstruction and present with <START:PHENOTYPE> stridor <END> . 
while we do not repeat the finding of <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired glucose tolerance <END> , we do find that it is only on the high fat diet that glucose tolerance is improved in the dgat1-deficient mice . 
since there are limited data on the phenotype of heterozygote (dgat1+ /- ) mice [1] , these were included in the study to give some perspective on how much inhibition of dgat1 might be required to treat <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and type 2 diabetes . 
conclusion many patients in the uk are exposed to hsv and its role in difficult to treat exacerbations of <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> may be underestimated . 
diagnosis may be considered in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic lung disease <END> , especially during exacerbations of <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> who are not responding to conventional treatment . 
with regard to a potential deterioration of perceived quality of life caused by delivery of implantable cardioverter defibrillator shocks for fast vts , we would recommend to program anti-tachycardia pacing attempts in all implantable cardioverter defibrillator patients regardless of the cycle length of the index <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> . 
this study gives biochemical evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired gluconeogenesis <END> as one of the causes for <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycaemia <END> observed in very long-chain acyl-coa dehydrogenase deficiency . 
conclusion this case indicates that a gastrointestinal stromal tumour may cause <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> also in the horse . 
background clinical signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> in adult equines are unusal . 
whenever a patient has the subjective perception of <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased fetal movement <END> , prompt evaluation in the form of antepartum fetal surveillance has been undertaken . 
the second consisted of 186 female and 68 male adults recruited as matched controls for a <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> study . 
case presentation a case of a gastrointestinal stromal tumour in a fjord pony with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent hypoglycemia <END> is presented . 
the mechanism causing the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> was not established . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> may cause <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> in different species including the horse , but <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> has not previously been reported in the horse associated with gastrointestinal stromal tumours . 
discussion our results are consistent with a previous report [2 ] in showing that dgat1-deficient mice have a lower body fat content than dgat1+ / + mice and are resistant to diet-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> . 
in humans and canines <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> caused by <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> is well established [1 ,2] , a few reports have described this occurrence in the horse [3-7] . 
when the last test within 7 days of delivery was analyzed , the <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased fetal movement <END> alone group had a lower incidence of cesarean delivery , cesarean delivery for fetal distress , and apgar scores less than 7 than patients with an additional indication for testing . 
introduction in patients with a severely <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> , various modifications of the usual coronary artery bypass graft-procedure have been published to avoid possible complications [1 ] . 
we propose that frequent p27 downregulation in <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> may be caused by skp2 overexpression thus enabling escape from normal androgen control . 
in those patients whose indication was <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased fetal movement <END> alone , there was a 3.7 times greater likelihood of diminished amniotic fluid volume . 
comparison of the first nonstress test results between those with <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased fetal movement <END> alone or in combination with another diagnosis demonstrated a similar incidence of nonreactivity and fetal heart rate decelerations . 
however the adverse effects of incomplete revascularization on survival have been particularly described for patients with an <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> ( left ventricular function ) [8 ] . 
conclusion these results suggest that although ablation of dgat1 improves glucose tolerance by preventing <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in mice fed on a high fat diet , it does not improve glucose tolerance in mice fed on a low fat diet . 
despite the urge to perform them , <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> patients may resist engagement in rituals for varying amounts of time depending on situational circumstances . 
in the present report , we investigate whether the checking behavior of quinpirole rats is subject to interruption , which is another attribute characteristic of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> compulsions . 
in summary , <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased fetal movement <END> continues to be an acceptable indication for fetal surveillance . 
after repetitive administration of nmbas during surgery , even with recovery of the tof ratio to 0.9 or more , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> from impaired neuromuscular transmission can occur . 
unless the patient has additional indications for fetal surveillance , the patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased fetal movement <END> with a reactive nonstress test and a/csd/grad/mkhordad/grepresults .last normal amniotic fluid volume does not appear to warrant additional testing . 
a more conservative estimate of the proportion canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> positive dogs was obtained by assuming that all individuals in group 3 would respond completely to a diet trial , and hence were canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> negative . 
initially , individuals classified as (1 ) "atopic grade 1 without adverse food reactions " , (2 ) "atopic grade 2 with adverse food reactions " , (3 ) " questionable atopic " , (4 ) " plausible atopic " and (5 ) " possible atopic " were all re-classified as being canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> positive . 
phenol red in tissue culture media is a weak estrogen , sufficient to stimulate the proliferation of er + mcf-7 cells-7 cells-7 human <START:PHENOTYPE> breast carcinoma <END> cells . 
in fact , one of the most effective psychotherapies for <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> - exposure and ritual prevention ( exposure and ritual prevention ) therapy - relies on this property . 
all underwent structured neurological examination , colour vision testing ( allowing calculation of a colour <START:PHENOTYPE> confusion <END> index corrected for age and alcohol) , and detailed psychometric testing . 
all of the horses enrolled in the study developed the characteristic <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal degeneration <END> that associated with prolonged <START:PHENOTYPE> vitamin e deficiency <END> [ 19 ] . 
interestingly , studies on <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> and mood have shown deficits in simple reaction time tasks in patients that report sadness or <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> . 
these factors were aimed to constitute a gradient making the suppression of quinpirole-induced checking more or less difficult , akin to the variable success that <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> patients have in resisting obsessions . 
previous reports have described resistance to diet-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> [2 ] and amelioration of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> due to the ay , but not the lepob or leprdb , mutation [3 ] in dgat1-deficient (dgat1-deficient ) mice . 
several and varied human diseases have been attributed to deficiency in vitamin e , including ischemic heart disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> , diabetes , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> , parkinson 's disease , alzheimer 's disease , and other neurologic disorders including <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> [28-30] . 
resistance to <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> was associated with increased reductions in body weight and food intake in response to peripherally but not centrally administered leptin [3 ,4] . 
this form of therapy has a success rate that may be higher and longer-lasting than anti-compulsive medication , and produces brain changes in <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> patients similar to those found with drug therapy ( reviewed in ) . 
here , we asked whether like <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> patients , quinpirole rats can desist from compulsive checking in the presence of checking-evoking cues . 
we have excluded cases with history of <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> , and extreme high levels of triglyceride in both samples . 
so , the results are particularly relevant for a population at low risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> . 
this group was selected for the direct immunofluorescence investigations , considering that the moderately virulent ( or low virulent ) variants of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus have large epidemiological importance , since due to the lack of typical clinical manifestation these cases may easily be overlooked in the field . 
the cell cultures or the cryostat sections were fixed with acetone and stained with fluorescent anti-classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> polyclonal serum by following oie guidelines ( in : manual of standards for diagnostic tests and vaccines . ed 5 . chap 2.1 .12 . paris : oie , 2004 ) . 
however , overexpression of dgat1 in adipose tissue of c57b l/6 mice was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> but not with impaired glucose disposal [9 ] . 
considering that this may lead to a delayed detection of the disease , special attention should be focused on the comparative pathology of such variants of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus . 
the most striking features , sufficient to constitute a syndrome , were acquired blue yellow colour vision deficits , coarse <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , impaired vibration sensation in the legs and <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> . 
in order to determine if respiratory syncytial virus ( respiratory syncytial virus )-specific ige responses at the time of <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiolitis <END> in infancy are related to recurrent wheezing and pulmonary function at 7- 8 years of age , a cohort of 43 infants was identified at the time of their initial respiratory syncytial virus <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiolitis <END> episode . respiratory syncytial virus-specific ige responses in nasopharyngeal secretions were determined , and patients were then followed prospectively with notation of the number of wheezing episodes and exposure to cigarette smoke at home . 
the mean probandwise monozygotic concordance rate for unipolar <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> (40% ) is more than twice that for dizygotic twins ( 17% )as well as for narrowly defined <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> (5 0 %:29% ) suggesting the presence of genetic determinants . 
changes in the efficiency of the alerting network as a consequence of mood and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> are further supported by the findings of liotti and tuckerwhere subjects induced into sadness showed no improvement in reaction times when given alerting cues before target stimuli were presented . 
pulmonary function test results were similar for groups with and without recurrent wheezing following <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiolitis <END> . 
recurrent wheezing following <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiolitis <END> was associated with the initial respiratory syncytial virus-ige response , as well as with a family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> . 
by contrast , overexpression of dgat1 in adipose tissue of fvb mice , a strain known to be resistant to diet-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , was not associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , but was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> [10 ] . 
second , the behavior of quinpirole-treated rats is directed at a likely stimulus for checking activity - the home base , and is thus an exaggerated form of normal checking in the rat , similar to the human condition where <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> compulsive checking is an exaggerated form of normal checking regarding one 's well-being and security . 
the nature of the toxic gain of function caused by the sod1 mutation in <START:PHENOTYPE> famyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> has been elusive [36 ,37] , yet recent studies [34 ] find that the mutated gene in transgenic mice places the cns under oxidative stress , which secondarily causes a deficiency of vitamin e [34 ] . 
finally , the checking behavior of quinpirole rats is partially attenuated by clomipramine , a drug used in the treatment of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> . 
for immunohistochemical examinations , monoclonal antibody " wh 303 " , specific to classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus glycoprotein e2 , was kindly provided by dr . 
studies on cases of familial <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> famyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> ) indicate a pathogenesis related to dominantly inherited point-mutations in the gene for cu , zn superoxide dismutase ( sod1 ) on chromosome 21 [34 ,35 ] . 
first , the behavior of quinpirole-treated rats looks like <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> checking in that it meets formal ethological criteria of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> compulsive checking identified by the investigators : a ) a preoccupation with and an exaggerated hesitancy to leave the item(s ) of interest ; 
in a recent publication we propose that behavior induced by chronic treatment with the d2/d3 dopamine agonist , quinpirole , may constitute an animal model of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> checking . 
this has been suggested previously in the case of the proline12alanine variant , where interactions with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , diet , birth-weightand weight regain after dietinghave been observed . 
even in patients without evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal glucose homeostasis <END> at baseline , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperglycemia <END> is common during critical illness . 
these findings suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased pulmonary function <END> following <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiolitis <END> is related to atopy and passive cigarette smoke exposure and may be reversible . 
as recently indicated , certain types of placental abnormality have also been ascribed to the villous immaturity ( low or no thy-1 differentiation protein expression in placental villi and a lack of blood sinusoid dilatation pt4 , see above ) accompanied by an existing ( <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> ) or absent placental hypertrophy ( <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> ) table 1 . 
however , infants with lower extremity <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertonicity <END> at 3 months were no different developmentally at 18 months from infants with normal tone . 
for <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> ( graded mild , moderate , severe ) the percentages for the springer spaniel were 25% , 46% , 29% compared to the poodle 47% , 53% , 0% ( p = 0.02 ) . 
we conclude that there is a high incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal muscle tone <END> in premature infants up to 18 months of age and that early truncal tone abnormalities are associated with a worse developmental outcome . 
as noted , <START:PHENOTYPE> quadriparesis <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced reflexes <END> and difficulty with ventilator weaning may be seen as a result of a number of neuromuscular disorders . 
furthermore , events of <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> ( graded none , once , more than once ) were 21% , 37% , 42 % for the springer spaniel and 63% , 16 % , 21% for the poodle ( p = 0.02 ) . 
while it is likely that our failure to find any evidence of heritability of the orienting network is due to either the small scale of our study or <START:PHENOTYPE> weaknesses <END> in our assay , it is certainly possible that low correlations among monozygotic twins reflects differential experiences that these twin pairs undergo . 
time exposure to <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperglycemia <END> is correlated with acute stressors and baseline glucose regulation , as characterized by hba1c . 
patients with low hba1c levels are less disposed to <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperglycemia <END> during severe illness than patients with higher , but still normal , hba1c . 
the isolates were checked to be free from african swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus ( african swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus ) by using haemabsorption-inhibition test as well as elisa . 
however , for <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> the percentages in the akita were 25% , 0% , 75 % ( p = 0.05 ) . 
the attenuated vaccine strain riems [subgroup 1 .1. , 10 ] was used as an avirulent representative of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus . 
these observations will contribute to a better understanding of the viral pathogenesis and to the introduction of more effective measures to control classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> . 
methods viruses and animals the studies involved three virulence variants of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus . 
the most common diseases were <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> ( n = 8 ) and atopy ( n = 4 ) . 
for these purposes , the virus distribution was determined by virus isolation ( virus isolation ) , the classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus antigen was visualised in paraformaldehyde fixed , paraffin-embedded tissue sections by a monoclonal antibody based , two-step immunohistochemical method and the viral rna was detected by in situ hybridisation , using a digoxigenin ( digoxigenin )-labelled riboprobe . 
by comparing the spread of three virulence variants of the virus in 64 animals , this study was performed in order to examine the tissue distribution of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus in the natural host , to obtain data of comparative pathology and to compare the applicability of virus detection methods . 
the animals were clinically healthy on arrival and serologically tested to be free of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus , bovine viral diarrhoea virus , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ( porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus ) , encephalomyocarditis virus (encephalomyocarditis virus ) and aujeszky 's disease virus ( aujeszky 's disease virus ) by using the standard diagnostic procedures of our institutes and our routine serological tests [11 ] . 
the acute <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> following neuromuscular blockage does not involve sensory responses . 
gbs is distinguished by evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> demyelination <END> on nerve conduction studies , in addition to elevated spinal fluid protein . 
in placental senescence or <START:PHENOTYPE> maternal diabetes <END> , they may lead to adverse outcomes later in the life of an individual . 
cip is characterized by nerve conduction and emg findings consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> axonal degeneration <END> of sensory and motor fibers . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell nevus <END> syndrome : <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell nevus <END> syndrome ; 
clinical investigation revealed <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyrexia <END> ( 39 .9 c) , lameness , reluctance to stand and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint pain <END> in multiple joints . 
this report describes a case of canine type ii immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> that was monitored blinded in the follow-up period using serial measurements of canine serum c-reactive protein concentration . 
case report diagnosis a 9-year old , female english springer spaniel was referred to the small animal veterinary teaching hospital , department of small animal clinical sciences , the royal veterinary and agricultural university , denmark with a history of weight-loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> , intermittent lameness , generalised <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphadenopathy <END> and recurrent febrile episodes during the preceding 8 weeks despite antibiotic and anti-inflammatory steroid treatment . 
secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> have also been reported [2 ,3] . 
fifteen isolates were recovered from the middle ear fluids obtained by tympanocentesis from children with <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> . 
usually , high percentage of patients present , at the time of referring , echocardiographyc evidences of impaired left ventricle function and clinical signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> . 
however , it has been noted that age of <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> presentation is not related to the occurrence of <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> . 
clinical presentation clinical presentation of congenital junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> usually ranges from birth to 4 weeks of age . 
fifteen were isolated from the sputum of 11 adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> as part of a prospective study being conducted at the buffalo veterans affairs medical center . 
sporadic cases of history of intrauterine <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> , with sometimes <START:PHENOTYPE> hydrops fetalis <END> , have been reported in patients who at birth showed overt junctional ectopic tachycardia [2 ,4,5 ] . 
diagnostic assessment the diagnosis of junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> usually is based on electrocardiographic evidence of a narrow complex <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> ( heart rate ranging from 160 bpm to 300 bpm ) and atrio-ventricular dissociation . 
influenzae in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> and adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> . 
the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> in presence of congenital junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> has been reported sporadic [6 ] . 
congenital junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> is hampered by high mortality . 
its clinical presentation may be dramatic , being associated in up to 60 % of cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomegaly <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> . 
incidence rates of <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular torticollis <END> vary between 0.3 and 2% [1 0 12 , 19 , 58 ] . 
conclusions unlike <START:PHENOTYPE> asthmatic <END> reactions , for which several therapeutic agents are available , the continuous use of anti-anaphylactic drugs to manage food allergies is a therapeutic option that neither widely practiced nor promoted . 
a <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular torticollis <END> is primarily a condition with a structural fibroid shortening of the sternocleidomastoid muscle , visible and palpable in the first weeks of life , as opposed to a postural torticollis that occurs secondary to a positional preference and a deformational <START:PHENOTYPE> plagiocephaly <END> [6 , 37 , 48 , 51 , 61 ] . 
the distinction between <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular torticollis <END> and postural torticollis is not always clear [15 ] . 
myocarditis , <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , ischemic cardiac injury and unstable angina . 
galli may cause <START:PHENOTYPE> anorexia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> , haemorrhages in the intestinal mucosa , obstruction of the intestinal lumen , altered hormone level and eventually death [1 ,12 ,27] in a wide range of avian species . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> pruritus <END> is usually not an initial feature , but can develop in case of secondary <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> [1 ,9-16 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> may be a potential cause of early death , even if nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome patients may have better outcome than patients with sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> ( as the desmoplastic subtype of <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> is associated with an improved survival compared to the classic form of <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> ) . 
long-haired dogs mainly show diffuse <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> , seborrhoea and follicular casts , whereas in some references the clinical description is divided even further between breeds [13-15 ] . 
therefore , this could be one argument to limit therapy to young children with gorlin syndrome and desmoplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> . 
background monitoring systemic inflammatory activity during steroid therapy of canine immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> ( immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> ) is difficult and mainly relies on clinical signs . 
prognosis the most common lesions accounting for nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome are usually not lin the radiation fieldthreatening . 
case presentation canine serum c-reactive protein ( c-reactive protein ) was measured serially and blinded during a 27- week follow-up period of a case of anaplasma phagocytophilia induced type ii immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> . 
clinical signs include varying degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> and seborrhoea with follicular casts as a distinctive feature , especially in the chronic phase of the disease . 
vitamin a analogs , such as retinoids , including isotretinoin , may play an important role in preventing or slowing the development of new <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> [140 ,16 0-164 ] . 
problems can derin the radiation fieldfrom some techniques used for the therapy of specific lesions : in the radiation field radiation therapy for <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> that may cause multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> . 
for this reason , nonstandard treatments should be consin the radiation fielded in children with gorlin syndrome and <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hypotonia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> were also mentioned as causes for developing positional preference and deformational <START:PHENOTYPE> plagiocephaly <END> . 
it will be interesting to determine whether asw homodimers display any binding to hint substrates , what degree of hint enzyme activity is retained by the putative hint-asw heterodimer , and whether gln127 is required for <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> of hint enzymatic activity in hint-asw heterodimers . 
central nervous system disorders <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral palsy <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral palsy <END> ) syndromes , in particular , spastic unilateral cerebral palsy , are neurological disorders that can cause asymmetry [3 , 7] . 
five patients had micro dislodgement defined as loss of capture or loss of sensing and one patient had surgical revision for right ventricular perforation with <START:PHENOTYPE> pericardial effusion <END> without further complications . 
serious disorders of the central nervous system are generally easy to recognize , but a <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral palsy <END> may also be discrete with subtle features . 
in a review on the epidemiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral palsy <END> , the world-wide prevalence of all types of cerebral palsy is estimated at 0.2% [43 ] . 
the neurodevelopmental ( motor ) behavior is an important issue in early recognition : persistent infantile reflexes and <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal muscle tone <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> motor delay <END> , abnormal spontaneous movement patterns ( especially general movements ) , and poor postural control are more or less predictors of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral palsy <END> [25 , 45 , 46 ] . 
although direct injury to the heart , such as occurs with ischemia-reperfusion injuryand other forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> , are accompanied by pronounced neutrophil influx into the damaged tissue , the current report is the first description of anaphylaxis induced accumulation of neutrophils in the heart .

azathioprine ( 2.0 mg/kg/day [imurel ; glaxo wellcome] ) was included in the therapy regimen from day 105 in combination with prednisolone to possibly lower the necessary dose of prednisolone ( clinical signs of steroid associated adverse effects [polyuria , <START:PHENOTYPE> polydipsia <END> , panting and cushingoid appearence] were observed at the dosage needed for sufficient immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> suppression ) . 
patients with gorlin syndrome can present with <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> , a malignant tumor of the posterior fossa [52 ] . 
ck-mb release three or more times above the upper limit of reference range , measured within the first 24 hours following isolated coronary artery bypass surgery should be regarded as prognostically significant and may form the basis for a simplified definition of peri-operative <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> following coronary artery bypass surgery . 
the corticosteroid dosage was attempted titrated to an acceptable clinical outcome regarding symptoms of the immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> and adverse effects of therapy ( fig . 1 ) . 
the dog had several periods with relapse of clinical symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> ( fig . 1 ) mainly in relation to tapering of the corticosteroid therapy . 
however , we recently reported that cellular oxidative stress , as assayed by the ratio of glutathione peroxidase ( glutathione peroxidase ) to superoxide dismutase ( superoxide dismutase ) activity , was higher in the mda-mb 231 <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> xenograft of mice that were fed 3% w/w fish oil concentrate with 2% w/w corn oil prior to and during 5 weeks of doxorubicin treatmentthan in the <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> xenografts of mice that were fed 5 % corn oil . 
[11 ] describe this as "maintaining a <START:PHENOTYPE> voracious appetite <END> to the end " . 
the message from this study is clear : <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial necrosis <END> following coronary artery bypass surgery is undesirable . 
the editorial by mahaffey and alpert [18 ] stressed the importance of developing a consensus about what constitutes a <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> post-coronary artery bypass surgery , especially since the joint european society of cardiology and american college of cardiology committee provided no standard criteria due to the lack of definitive data [12 ] . 
based on the clinical and paraclinical examinations , the dog was considered to suffer from immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> haemolytic anaemia <END> and a type ii immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> secondary to an a . 
since endogenous antioxidative enzymes can be altered by fish oil concentrate consumption , we wondered if oxidative stress was already increased in the mda-mb 231 <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> xenograft of mice consuming fish oil concentrate before the initiation of doxorubicin therapy , thereby increasing the sensitivity of the cancer xenograft to doxorubicin . 
developmental dysplasia of the hip developmental dysplasia of the hip (developmental dysplasia of the hip ) has a high rate of co-morbidity with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular torticollis <END> ( 8 20% ) [11 ] and , to a lesser extent , with postural torticollis or <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> [50 ] . 
there were three deaths for refractory <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> . 
one patient died of previously unknown bronchial carcinoma and one patient died of mechanical <START:PHENOTYPE> intestinal obstruction <END> . 
this is particularly important in patients with the desmoplastic nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome subtype [47 ] . 
the scabs usually <START:PHENOTYPE> fall <END> off by the end of the first month following photodynamic therapy [16 ] . 
the management of patients with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome consists of regular visits ( every 2 3 months ) to a dermatologist , especially during adolescence [16 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> are then treated with red light ( usually produced by a laser ) that leads to dye activation and , definitin the radiation fieldy , to death of these cells [16 ] . 
introduction junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> ( junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> ) is a rare type of <START:PHENOTYPE> supraventricular arrhythmia <END> . 
when the springer spaniels , standard poodles and the akitas with generalized signs were compared ( n = 51 ) , the spaniels showed significantly more severe clinical signs than the poodles at diagnosis regarding <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , seborrhoea , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> and the overall severity of clinical signs . 
a diagnosis of type ii immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> ( immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> ) and immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> haemolytic anaemia <END> ( immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> haemolytic anaemia <END> ) was established and antibiotic therapy (doxycycline 10 mg/kg sid [ronaxan ; merial] ) was initiated . 
two are the possible clinical presentations of this arrhythmia : as a primary idiopathic disorder during infancy , configuring the so called " congenital " junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> , or more often as a transient phenomenon immediately after surgery for <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> , giving rise to the " post-operative " variety . 
elevated levels of plasma urea have been reported as an effect of <START:PHENOTYPE> malnutrition <END> in reindeer [10 ,15 ] and other ruminants [5 ,6 ,3] , and can be explained by catabolism of muscle tissue when the energy intake is insufficient . 
phagocytophilum infection and rule out other potential suspect causes of immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> haemolytic anaemia <END> and type ii immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> , thoracic radiographs , abdominal ultrasound , pcr tests for canine distemper virus , ehrlichia spp. , serum antibody titer-tests for borrelia spp. , bartonella spp . 
at follow-up , the degree of clinical signs for otitis externa and <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> differed significantly between the breeds . 
second , the intensities of shorter probes <START:PHENOTYPE> fall <END> off sharply at exon boundaries , which may allow more precise estimates of splice sites ( see below ) . 
an association with birth trauma and <START:PHENOTYPE> breech presentation <END> is mentioned , but the evidence is weak , since <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular torticollis <END> is also seen in infants born via a cesarean section [11 , 32 ] . 
the complete blood count , blood smear and serum biochemistry revealed a regenerative <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> characterised by <START:PHENOTYPE> increased reticulocyte count <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> spherocytosis <END> and erythrocyte autoagglutination . 
cytology revealed reactive <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphadenopathy <END> in lymph notes and neutrophilic inflammation in all joints sampled , with anaplasma phagocytophilum-like inclusions in occasional neutrophils . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular torticollis <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular torticollis <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular torticollis <END> ) is frequently described in the literature . 
sin the radiation fieldeffects include <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , chills , decreased whin the radiation fieldblood cell count , and pain at the sin the radiation fieldof injection . 
coli-isolate originating from broilers suffering from <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory distress <END> ( difficulties in breathing ) was grown overnight in an enrichment media ( lb-broth ) to reach the desired infection dose [14 ] . 
in humans , the occurrence of perioperative <START:PHENOTYPE> ecg abnormalities <END> an enlarged "silent myocardial ischemia " is well recognised [10 ] . 
interferon has also been proposed in experin the radiation fieldtal studies for the treatment of <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> . 
recently , nodular <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> resistant to multiple forms of treatment in two patients with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome were treated with systemic porfin the radiation field sodium-based photodynamic therapy with a good response to treatment on clinical evaluation and on measurement by a 20-mhz high-resolution ultrasound [152 ] . 
in experimental models , treatment with antibodies to migration inhibitory factor , reversed or prevented <START:PHENOTYPE> colitis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> gastric ulcer <END> formation . 
were reported as a cause of type ii immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> in dogs [13 ] where it is assumed that the infectious process provides an antigenic source for immune complex formation , and either the antigen or circulating complexes are deposited within the synovium to initiate inflammation by a type iii hypersensitivity reaction [14 ] . 
thus , a marked increase in c-reactive protein were observed on two occasions , related to the reappearence of clinical signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> . 
close to the overall picture of a 70 % <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positivity among the sick tolling retrievers included in the study . 
cryosurgery , in a few cases , was complicated by nerve damage and numbness , but in general has no sin the radiation fieldeffects , except for <START:PHENOTYPE> scarring <END> . 
one of the tolling retrievers with a homogeneous indirect immunofluorescence-antinuclear antibodies pattern showed <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> and another dog showed plasmacytic and pyogranulomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> , both of these disorders with a probable immune-mediated origin [30,31 ] . 
presence of systemic clinical signs , <START:PHENOTYPE> pruritus <END> , otitis externa and paw involvement was graded 0 1 ( no , yes ) . 
number of events of <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> was graded as 1 3 ( none , once , more than once ) . 
the possible systemic rheumatic disorder in the tolling retrievers seems to be associated with a <START:PHENOTYPE> familial predisposition <END> , as five of the dogs with signs of disease came from the same litter and another dog with disease had the same father as the litter-mates . 
at the time of arrival , a physical examination was performed on dogs presenting with a history compatible with pyometra ( <START:PHENOTYPE> polyuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polydipsia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anorexia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , vulvar discharge , recent oestrus ) . 
for each case of generalized sebaceous adenitis the degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , seborrhoea and overall severity of skin lesions were given a score from 1 3 ( mild , moderate , severe ) . 
long term sin the radiation fieldeffects include <START:PHENOTYPE> scarring <END> , and rarely , nerve damage . 
a predictive factor for an ocular origin of torticollis is the family history of ocular problems , in particular , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nystagmus <END> . 
the presence of myocardial damage may often be overlooked an enlarged difficult to detect when suspected if it does not lead to compromised cardiac function , <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> or regional abnormal ventricular motion . 
we evaluated the predisposition role of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitamin e deficiency <END> on the risk of equine motor neuron disease . 
in the literature search , no match was found for <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> and torticollis , except in syndromes such as klippel-feil or moebius . 
a connection between ear malformation and <START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> is mentioned [23] . 
skin changes have been reported as part of several systemic rheumatic disorders in both humans and dogs , especially in those cases with a probable <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> diagnosis [2 ,6 ,9 ,11 ,27] . 
the c-reactive protein was already increased at the first relapses of clinical signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> (day 47 49 and day 61 95 ) and c-reactive protein was persistently high during the periods of clinical signs . 
bone marrow suppression with panleukopenia ( wbc<6.5 109/l ) ( fig . 1 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> ( thrombocyte count<200 109/l ) was observed at day 170 , where the azathioprine dosage was halved and later discontinued at day 18 0 . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> is a common symptom , accounting for 1 % to 6% of hospital admission and up to 3% of emergency room visits . 
the patients with a homogeneous indirect immunofluorescence-antinuclear antibodies staining pattern , and a concomitant chromosomal staining , had a tendency to show clinical signs compatible with <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> , systemic lupus erythematosus ( with e.g . musculoskeletal disorders , skin disorders , <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polymyositis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> ) . 
introduction <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> is defined as a sudden temporary <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of consciousness <END> associated with a loss of postural tone , with spontaneous recovery that does not require electrical or chemical cardioversion . 
in an earlier study [2] , canine patients with indirect immunofluorescence-antinuclear antibodies-positive systemic <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disease <END> could be subdivided into 2 groups according to clinical signs and the indirect immunofluorescence-antinuclear antibodies pattern . 
and latheca externa cells lutheca externa cellsal corpus lutheca externa cellsum of diminishing size ( ~7 mm ) with massive <START:PHENOTYPE> bleeding <END> into the central cavity ( bluish color ) and no accompanying follicles . 
there is , of course , a possibility that the tolling retriever breed is affected by different immune-mediated diseases ( including <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> or systemic lupus erythematosus-related disorders ) , giving rise to the different indirect immunofluorescence-antinuclear antibodies appearances . 
the systemic lupus erythematosus-related diseases may , as in human patients , have overlapping clinical features and may show <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> reactivity towards different ( usually non-chromosomal ) nuclear antigens [2 ,14 ,21] . 
the sebaceous adenitiss software was used for analysis ( sebaceous adenitiss institute inc. , <START:PHENOTYPE> cary <END> , nc , 27513 , usebaceous adenitis ) . 
among the tolling retrievers showing the different clinical signs , the <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positivity varied from 67 75 % , i.e . 
another cause can be related to the cardio-respiratory or the digestive system , such as sandifer syndrome ( fluctuating asymmetry with abnormal body movements and contortions of the neck , associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> gastroesophageal reflux <END> ) [9 , 17 , 21] . 
when comparing signs such as stiffness , <START:PHENOTYPE> joint pain <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle pain <END> , skin changes and <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> with different indirect immunofluorescence-antinuclear antibodies reactivity , there was no clear-cut association found . 
the most alarming causes of asymmetry are related to neurological syndromes , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> syringomyelia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , high intracranial pressure , postencephalitic syndromes , or life-threatening <START:PHENOTYPE> tumors of the central nervous system <END> [3 , 7 , 12 , 19 , 20 , 30] . 
conclusions nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease represents a spectrum of disease from benign <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and even <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> . 
clinical studies suggest that serum levels of the above cytokines differ among patients with nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and healthy controls . 
for 38 days no clinical signs of immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> were observed on a combination of prednisolone ( 0.125- 0.5 mg/kg bid ) and azathioprine ( 2.0 mg/kg sid ) , with acceptable degrees of adverse effects at the lower doses of prednisolone . 
symptoms of immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> returned at day 143 . 
characteristic pathological lesions including airsacculitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> peritonitis <END> and/or polyserositis were seen in all groups infected with e . 
tumor induced <START:PHENOTYPE> cachexia <END> was decreased in mice consuming fish oil concentrate . 
an inherited recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> of unknown origin with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal amyloidosis <END> in chinese shar-pei dogs was also associated with elevated interleukin-6 [ 19 ] . 
although tilt table testing started in 198 0s , it assumed an important role in the evaluation of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> in 1990s , showing that neurally mediated mechanism is a common etiology of unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> [9-12 ] . 
later a large number of studies on electrophysiology testing appeared , which led to a better understanding of the roles and limitations of tests in <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> [5-8 ] . 
in the early 198 0s , several studies showed that the cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> was often not established , and subgroups were identified with high mortality and sudden death rates [1-4] . 
in our material 7/2 0 dogs were <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positive , 1/2 0 was anti extractable nuclear antigens positive , 2/13 were <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid factor positive <END> and 10/13 presented with elevated il-6 . 
the evaluation and management of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> has dramatically changed over the past 15 years . 
none of the dogs included in the study showed any <START:PHENOTYPE> joint swelling <END> . 
among 9 dogs tested for all parameters , one was <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> and another was <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid factor positive <END> only , while a third was <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positive and showed elevated interleukin-6 level . 
joint involvement in <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> and in some other antinuclear antibodies-positive rheumatic diseases is classically described as non-erosive , non-deforming <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> with the absence of erosions on radiographs [11 ,27] . 
approach to the patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> the proper diagnostic and therapeutic approach requires careful analysis of the patient 's symptoms and of the clinical findings . 
many of the systemic <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune diseases <END> , in both dogs and humans , present circulating antinuclear antibodiess . 
the purpose of this article is to highlight the clinical approach and management of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> . 
however , supportive clinical signs are always required to establish diagnostic features for systemic <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune diseases <END> [2 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> , the premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures , is most frequently described in relation to asymmetry and <START:PHENOTYPE> plagiocephaly <END> , possibly as a result of the over-referral of infants with deformational non-synostotic deformational plagiocephaly to craniofacial or plastic surgery clinics . 
this and the diagnostic significance of this factor in immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> in dogs are aspects that should be looked at in the future . 
such <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> can be demonstrated by the indirect immunofluorescence ( indirect immunofluorescence ) <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> test . 
one breton and one german shepherd dog were <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid factor positive <END> , but none of them presented signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> loss of consciousness <END> is also common in healthy young adults , although most do not seek medical attention . 
detection of rheumatoid factor in canine sera by latex agglutination technique is commonly used in screening , but the test is not specific for diagnosing <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> is a frequent symptom in the elderly . 
streptococcus suis is an important cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> meningitis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> and septicaemia , especially in young pigs . 
in conclusion , c-reactive protein measurements seemed potentially valuable as an unbiased marker of the inflammatory activity during immunosuppressive treatment of type ii immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> in the present case , seemingly providing clinically useful information superior to that of complete blood count and clinical observations . 
further studies should be conducted to investigate the general applicability of c-reactive protein as an unbiased marker of inflammatory activity during treatment of immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> . 
coli may cause airsacculitis , salpingitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> peritonitis <END> , polyserositis , septicemia and other extra-intestinal diseases in chickens , turkeys and other avian species . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> congenital abnormalities <END> or malformations musculoskeletal congenital malformations must be considered in an asymmetry that is present immediately after birth [3 , 7] . 
in fact , migration inhibitory factor may serve as a prognostic marker for <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> since serum levels correlate with disease progression . 
canine serum c-reactive protein has earlier been studied as a marker of disease-activity in <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoarthritis <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoarthritis <END> ) [ 19] , where only slightly elevated levels were observed . 
fish oil concentrate reduced tumor induced <START:PHENOTYPE> cachexia <END> . 
however , a marked difference between the c-reactive protein levels in a localized process ( as <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoarthritis <END> [21] ) and a generalized inflammatory disease ( as immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> in the present case) , is expected , as c-reactive protein is a marker of systemic inflammation ( produced in the liver upon stimulation by an increased level of circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines[20] ) . 
postmortem studies on afflicted horses revealed that <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle wasting <END> result from degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain stem [4 ] . 
the incidence of this single suture <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> is rare ( 1 3 cases to 100,000 newborns ) [37 , 42 ] and can be clinically differentiated from deformational <START:PHENOTYPE> plagiocephaly <END> by four major signs : from the vertex view , a trapezoid head shape can be observed , a palpable unilateral ridge , bulging of the unilateral mastoid , and an asymmetric skull base with tilt to the ipsilateral side [24 , 33 , 42 ] . 
equine motor neuron disease is a neurodegenerative disorder of the horse characterized by progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle wasting <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> [4 ,5 ] . 
the impact of the <START:PHENOTYPE> premature closure of cranial sutures <END> in complex <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> is impressive : strong progressive deformation of the skull , risk of increasing intracranial pressure , and developmental problems . 
as in <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> , horses afflicted with equine motor neuron disease lose 30% of the somatic motor neurons in the spinal cord and the brain stem before they manifest clinical signs [9 ] . 
primary <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> is either simple or compound and part of a genetic syndrome [36 ] . 
the nature and the distribution of the neurodegenerative changes in equine motor neuron disease are strikingly similar to those reported in human progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular atrophy <END> , a form of <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> ) or lou gehrig 's disease [6-8 ] . 
premature closing of one lambdoid suture is the most frequently mentioned differential diagnosis of deformational <START:PHENOTYPE> plagiocephaly <END> [24 , 33 , 36 ] . 
the neuropathologic findings are a common theme of neurofilament accumulation in neurons and proximal axons , progressive motor neuron degeneration and <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> . 
this could have a positive effect on case management of type ii immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> by possibly enabling early assessment of treatment efficiency and detection of undesirable inflammatory activity , unbiased by treatment . 
in this study , we wanted to test the hypothesis that there are changes in the <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> xenografts of fish oil concentrate fed mice that sensitize the tumor to oxidative stress . 
the observations made in the present case suggest that serial measurements of c-reactive protein during immunosuppressive therapy of canine type ii immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> could be useful as an objective marker of inflammatory activity . 
mda-mb 231 human <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> bearing athymic mice were fed fish oil concentrate ( fish oil concentrate ) or control diets , with and without supplemental vitamin e and were euthanized both before and after doxorubicin treatment to test this hypothesis . 
the dogs in this study did not show signs of neck pain , <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> anorexia <END> , which is in contrast to the findings in tolling retrievers suffering from srma [3 ] . 
it is important to exclude other causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> joint pain <END> , especially in older dogs . 
well-known malformations are those of the spine , such as a <START:PHENOTYPE> klippel-feil syndrome <END> , hemi-vertebrae , and a hemi-atlas [22 , 38 , 64 ] . 
exceptional phenomena are <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia <END> or aplasia of the face , neck , or trunk muscles [2 ] . 
patients may show defects in other systems as well , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> , or a <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> . 
in order to confirm a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> , joint fluid analysis would have been preferable . 
the clinical signs , with stiffness most prominent after resting and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint pain <END> that is waxing and waning and affecting different legs and joints , indicate a rheumatic disease with <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> . 
in general , the therapeutic regimen of type ii immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> is directed against the infectious agent , where recovery can be seen upon clearance of the infectious agent [1 ,13 ] . 
infants with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nystagmus <END> and restrictive or paralytic <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> may use anomalous head positions to maximize visual function [26 , 47 , 63 ] . 
when clinical signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> have resolved , the dosages are gradually reduced and if signs return the dosage is increased [1 ] . 
dpt4a , placental hypertrophy terminal villi persist in a young/immature state with compensatory development of additional young terminal villi ( maternal <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> fetal macrosomia <END> ) . 
ept4b , placental atrophy terminal villi persist in a young/immature state without compensatory development of additional young terminal villi ( <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth retardation <END> and poor apgars ) . 
conclusion the study elucidated the role of <START:PHENOTYPE> vitamin e deficiency <END> on the risk of equine motor neuron disease . 
local abnormalities , such as a <START:PHENOTYPE> vascular ring <END> ( around the trachea ) or <START:PHENOTYPE> tracheomalacia <END> , are occasionally an indirect cause of an asymmetric posture [60 ] . 
despite the observations made , it is difficult to conclude that the observed association between <START:PHENOTYPE> vitamin e deficiency <END> and the risk of equine motor neuron disease is causal because the samples in which determinations were made were collected at the same time the cases were diagnosed . 
hofer and colleagues [21] provide evidence that health related quality of life and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> are distinctive psychological entities , but that <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> represents the most important indirect influence on the course of health related quality of life in <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> patients . 
in other species , endothelial accumulations of this nature have been identified as ceroids associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> vitamin e deficiency <END> [20] . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> / <START:PHENOTYPE> polymyositis <END> syndrome ( polyarthritis / <START:PHENOTYPE> polymyositis <END> syndrome ) is defined by presence of non-erosive polyarthritis , chronic active myositis in at least 2 muscle biopsies and negative for <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> . 
with a better understanding of these changes , it might be possible to find ways to prevent or treat intermediate syndrome or to predict which patients with intermediate syndrome are likely to develop <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> . 
[5 ] have defined criteria for diagnosis of immune-based <START:PHENOTYPE> arthropathies <END> of dogs . 
finally , it remains to be determined whether and under what circumstances can immune modulation be discontinued without significant risk of relapse in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients that have achieved remission with immunotherapy . 
the present study did not catch more than one border collie , but before the study started several young , familiarily related dogs of this breed had been observed in this practice with <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> and muscle and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint pain <END> . 
the strains included 4 isolates from middle ear fluid ( 955 , 1826 , 1749 , 9289 ) and 4 isolates from the sputum of adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> ( 74p1 0h1 , 5p11h1 , 5p1 0h1 , 14p13h1 ) . 
a previous report showed that the open field behavior of rats sensitized to the dopamine agonist quinpirole satisfies 5 performance criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> compulsive checking behavior <END> . 
[8 ] found a high percentage of springer spaniels , german shepherd dogs and border collies , less than one year old and familiarly related , showing immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> and muscle and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint pain <END> . 
the clinical findings , the fact that no patients responded to antibiotic therapy , that many of them were <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positive and all responded to immune suppressive doses of prednisolone , indicate that the <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> and other clinical signs in these dogs were immune-mediated . 
this is further supported by that none of the patients during the past 2 years since the study was ended has shown evidence of another reason for the <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> . 
discussion infection seems unlikely to be the reason for the <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> in this material . 
in this report we analyse esr1 and esr2 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (single nucleotide polymorphisms ) for association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> . 
list of abbreviations implantable cardioverter-defibrillator : implantable cardioverter device cabg : coronary artery bypass grafting mi : <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> ejection fraction : ejection fraction authors ' contributions asa : first author , conception and design , data collection , analysis and interpretation of data , and drafting the manuscript . 
preoperative <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> often predict the occurrence of symptoms or psychopathology after surgery [4 ,19 ,20] . 
it is not surprising that symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> have been associated with a marked alteration in mental health related quality of life and worse outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery . 
model for age-related changes in [ca2+]i regulation in peripheral adrenergic neurones one hypothesis suggested by numerous researchers is that advancing age leads to [ca2+]i dysregulation and <START:PHENOTYPE> neuronal loss <END> ( choi , 1992 ; kirischuk & verkhratsky , 1996 ; ichas & mazat , 1998 ; thibault et al. , 1998 ; begley et al. , 1999 ) . 
in an effort to extend the parallel between the drug-induced phenomenon and human <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> ) , the present study investigated whether the checking behavior of quinpirole rats is subject to interruption , which is an attribute characteristic of obsessive-compulsive disorder compulsions . 
the intermediate syndrome ( intermediate syndrome ) , which results in <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> in the limbs , neck , and throat , develops in some patients 24 96 hours after poisoning . 
based on this case and the relevant literature we suggest a link between a silent <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> , paradoxic pathogen dissemination to the brain , and development of brain abscess . 
here we present a case of brain abscess associated with a <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> in a 53-year old man with dental-gingival <START:PHENOTYPE> sepsis <END> treated in the intensive care unit . 
unlike pediatric <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> , minor intracardiac right-to-left shunting due to <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> has not been appreciated as a cause of brain abscess in adults . 
along with advances in mechanical ventilation and intensive care , immunotherapy has been one of the major factors contributing to improved outcome in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , and contemporary disease-specific mortality is less than 5 % [95 ] . 
clinical signs include <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> ( >40 c) , <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> and severe neck pain . 
whether corticosteroid treatment begun early in the course of ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis can prevent generalization has yet to be demonstrated . 
the benefit of thymectomy in non-thymomatous seropositive <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is poorly defined at present , and an international , multicenter trial is currently being undertaken to determine whether and to what degree thymectomy is beneficial in non-thymomatous disease [76 ] . 
issues pertaining to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis include determining the pathophysiologic role of muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies in the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , whether the immunological attack on the endplate region in muscle-specific tyrosine kinase <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is similar to that of seropositive <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , and whether thymectomy benefits patients with muscle-specific tyrosine kinase <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
unresolved questions there are several contemporary issues related to <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis that remain to be resolved . 
five esr2 single nucleotide polymorphisms displayed nominal significant allelic association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in women and one in men . 
the most frequent symptom of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> is compulsive checking , shown by 63 % of the patients . 
results no esr1 snp was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> . 
background <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> ) is a <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric illness <END> , more prevalent than <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> panic disorder <END> . 
early in the course of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , symptoms may fluctuate and occasionally remit , although such remissions are rarely permanent [89 ,93 ] . 
like normal behavior , <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> checking involves the performance of actions supposedly related to security , orderliness or accuracy , but is characterized by the repeated and excessive re-doing of such rituals . 
three major stages of generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis have been proposed [94 ] . 
the two esr2 single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> with nominal p value < 0.01 were genotyped in a second cohort where no association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> was observed . 
compulsive checking interferes with normal everyday functioning because of the many hours of time spent in the performance of checking rituals , a preoccupation that in extreme cases may even prevent the <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> sufferer from leaving home [ , p . 86 ] . 
from a clinical point of view it seems rational to classify most of them as having <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> / <START:PHENOTYPE> polymyositis <END> syndrome , but the fact that many of them are <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positive , without showing signs of systemic lupus ery-thematosus , exclude them from any group . 
in the ultimate stage of " burned-out " disease , untreated <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> may become fixed in association with <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> . 
the patients of [3 ] comprising 2 springer spaniels , 2 cavalier king charles spaniels , 1 cocker spaniel and 1 whippet and sorted into the <START:PHENOTYPE> polyarthritis <END> / <START:PHENOTYPE> polymyositis <END> syndrome category had been sick for several weeks before they got their diagnosis . 
results strengthen the quinpirole preparation as an animal model of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> compulsive checking . 
prior to the widespread use of immunomodulators , prognosis for patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis was grim with about 30% mortality [89 ] . 
on the contrary , clinically silent intracardiac shunting due to <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> ) has not been appreciated as a source of septic brain emboli in adults . 
however , autopsy studies have detected a <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> in 20 35 % of adults , and a cross-sectional study has implicated <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovales <END> in the pathogenesis of embolic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> [7-9] . 
hence right-to-left circulatory <START:PHENOTYPE> shunts <END> can serve as entrance gates for bland or septic thrombi into the arterial circulation [1-3] . 
methods 23 esr1 and 11 esr2 tag-single nucleotide polymorphisms , covering most of the common haplotype variation in each gene according to hapmap data , were analysed by chi2 for association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in a cohort comprising 705 adults with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and 402 lean individuals . 
pediatric brain abscess secondary to paradoxic infection via congenital intracardiac <START:PHENOTYPE> shunts <END> , as well as adult brain abscess resulting from extracardiac <START:PHENOTYPE> shunts <END> , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary arteriovenous malformation <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary arteriovenous malformation <END> ) , are well recognized [4-6 ] . 
affected horses reveal a <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentary retinopathy <END> which involves the retinal pigment epithelium . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> affected predominantly the proximal limb muscles and those supplied by the cranial nerves . 
intermediate syndrome was often associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> . 
each horse received a clinical score according to a multidimensional scale that has several categories , including weight , evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , short strides , trembling , recumbency , feet under body , <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> , head hanging , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle fasciculation <END> , shifting , tail slack , and collapse . 
variations in incidence rates ( e.g . <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular torticollis <END> ) are inevitable , considering the variety in inclusion criteria and diagnostic tests used in the studies . 
initial presentations with oropharyngeal and <START:PHENOTYPE> limb weakness <END> are less common . 
myasthenic symptoms and signs may worsen in the setting of systemic illness , particularly viral upper <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory infections <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid disease <END> , pregnancy , increased body temperature , and exposure to drugs that impair neuromuscular transmission ( table 1 ) [23,92 ] . 
myasthenic crisis , or <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> due to myasthenic <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> occurs in about 20% of patients , usually within the first year of illness [90 ,91 ] . 
organophosphate poisoning leads to three main syndromes : (1 ) acute cholinergic syndrome , (2 ) intermediate syndrome ( intermediate syndrome ) , and (3 ) organophosphate-induced delayed <START:PHENOTYPE> polyneuropathy <END> ( organophosphateidpn ) . 
intermediate syndrome was first described [5 ] as a syndrome of muscular <START:PHENOTYPE> paralysis <END> occurring in conscious patients 24 96 h following ingestion , after their acute cholinergic syndrome was treated with atropine . 
more recently , scharf and colleagues found no significance in using signal-averaged ecg in predicting <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> in patients that undergo cabg . 
in addition , ventricular late potentials have been recorded in 70 90 percent of patients with spontaneous sustained and inducible <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> after <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> , in only 0 6 percent of normal volunteers , and in 7 to 15 percent of patients after myocardial infarction that do not have <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> [12 ] . 
the results of the <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> , anti extractable nuclear antigens , rheumatoid factor and interleukin-6 analyses are presented in table 1 . 
nonetheless , when observing a sub-population that underwent cabg , signal-averaged ecg did not predict <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> [12 ] . 
ventricular late potentials registered from signal-averaged ecg recordings have been used in risk stratification of patients at risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> [18 ] . 
although a retrospective review such as our study has many potential inherent <START:PHENOTYPE> weaknesses <END> and should not be compared to a rigorously performed prospective randomized trial , in our opinion the question remains as to why the cabg <START:PHENOTYPE> patch <END> trial did not show any significant improvement in survival with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . 
seven out of 20 patients were <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positive , 1 out of 20 was anti extractable nuclear antigens positive on both tests , 2 out of 13 was <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid factor positive <END> and 10 out of 13 patients presented elevated il-6 values . 
in the <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> group ( 4 dogs ) 1 bearded collie and 1 large poodle were <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positive . 
however , they suggest that the repetitive nerve stimulation tests might be useful in the clinical management of patients with organophosphate poisoning , particularly since such tests could provide an early warning of impending <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> . 
most importantly , in the four patients with intermediate syndrome who developed <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> , an repetitive nerve stimulation response pattern called severe decrement ( a reduced response to the first electrical shock and then no response to the subsequent shocks ) was seen before <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> . 
finally , there were other characteristic changes in muscle responses to repetitive nerve stimulation in 30 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> not severe enough for a diagnosis of intermediate syndrome ( incomplete or forme fruste intermediate syndrome ) . 
in other words , intermediate syndrome is a spectrum disorder in which the <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> and neuromuscular junction problems caused by organophosphate poisoning gradually progress over time through a series of electrophysiological changes that will sometimes resolve quickly and only in the most severe cases will result in <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> . 
he was also <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positive . 
one out of 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> negative german shepherds presented elevated interleukin-6 level , and the other did not . 
the venous cannula was then introduced into the left femoral vein ( figure 1 ) via the left sapheno-femoral junction using the seldinger technique . cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted with careful monitoring of the head for any evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> or petechial haemorrhage . 
in the <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle pain <END> group ( 12 dogs ) 2 english setters and 1 flatcoated retriever tested positive for <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> , and 1 breton and 1 german shepherd were <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid factor positive <END> . 
it is possible that many patients who did not receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator either experienced <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> or had episodes of ventricular tachyarrhythmias that were not manifested or recognized clinically . 
in the <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , muscle and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint pain <END> group ( 4 dogs ) 1 berner sennen and 1 border collie tested positive for <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> and the berner sennen was also anti extractable nuclear antigens positive . 
antibodies against native dna were not detected in any serum of 20 dogs with <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , and antibodies against deoxynucleoproteins was only found in serum of one out of 12 dogs . 
this dog was a two-year-old male english setter in the <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle pain <END> group . 
finally , the existence of more modern technology in manufacturing of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator devices may have been a reason for the difference in results between our series and the results of the cabg <START:PHENOTYPE> patch <END> trial . 
our patient population included all patients with lower ejection fraction than those enrolled in the cabg <START:PHENOTYPE> patch <END> trial . 
additionally , <START:PHENOTYPE> dehydration <END> , and other drugs can affect the toxicity of gentamicin . 
variability of device manufacturing may also play a role in the altering the results of the cabg <START:PHENOTYPE> patch <END> trial [23] . 
discussion assays of 30 randomly chosen clinical isolates from the middle ear of children with <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> and from the sputum of adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> show that isolates of nontypeable h . 
our overall population showed <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> symptomultiplied by pulse width with a mean nyha class of 2.1 with a narrow qrs width of 112 .5 32.2multiplied by pulse width . 
background endeavors to manage <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> have been heavily reliant on controlling energy intake and expenditure equilibrium , but have failed to curtail the overweight and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> epidemic . 
in this report we analyse polymorphisms covering most of the common haplotype variation in the esr1 and esr2 genes for association with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in two large cohorts of swedish caucasians . 
furthermore , neither rs2234693 nor rs9340799 was associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in swedish women [16 ] . 
esr2 has primarily been investigated in <START:PHENOTYPE> eating disorders <END> . 
esr2 rs928554 and rs4986938 , but not rs1256 049 , have been associated with bulimic behavior [ 19 ] and rs1256 049 , but not rs4986938 , with <START:PHENOTYPE> anorexia <END> nervosa [20] . 
however , whether esr1 protects against <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> or is upregulated as a result of low body mass index remains to be established .

the post-anaesthetic period was associated with increased lipolysis and <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> in the colic horses , indicating a negative energy balance during the first week post-operatively . 
sample 2 had less stringent inclusion criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and leanness in comparison with sample 1 . 
381 subjects in sampe 1 were also included in our previously reported analysis of two esr1 single nucleotide polymorphisms in <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> [16 ] . 
to our knowledge , this represents the first extensive analysis of the impact of variations in the esr1 and esr2 genes for the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> . 
methods subjects and clinical evaluation samples 1 and 2 were recruited for the purpose of studying genes underlying susubcutaneouseptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , table 1 . 
influenzae grows as a biofilm in <START:PHENOTYPE> otitis media <END> with effusion and in the respiratory tract of adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> , it will be important to characterize the bacterial surface antigens of the organism during growth as a biofilm . 
in sample 1 , the lean subjects were subjects > 45 years old and had never reached body mass index > 25 kg/m2 whereas the obese subjects had body mass index > 30 kg/m2 at < 20 years of age or morbid <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , i.e . 
the aim of selecting subjects with an extreme body mass index phenotype in sample 1 was to enrich for a genetic impact on <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> [22] . 
the size of sample 1 provided 90 % power to detect an allele with a frequency of 20% among controls and odds ratio ( odds ratio ) 1.5 to develop <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> assuming a threshold p value of 0.05 and dominant impact on <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> [23] .

testing for detection and successful shock therapy of <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> at 10 joule below maximum shock energy was performed in all cases . 
a prospective definition for intermediate syndrome was developed on the basis of senanayake and karalliedde 's original description [5 ] , namely significant <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> in at least three of the following muscle groups ( extraocular , neck flexor , proximal limb , and facial ) observed at least 24 h after ingestion of organophosphate . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of proximal muscles and neck flexion was considered significant when the muscle power was grade 3 or less ( medical research council [mrc ] grading ) : <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of respiratory muscles was not considered a requirement for the diagnosis . 
in 13 patients serial electrophysiological studies were not successful ( withdrawal of consent , four ; unable to perform due to <START:PHENOTYPE> restlessness <END> /delirium , seven ; technical difficulties , two ) . 
results and discussion our optimization efforts focused on two well characterized genes , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( rb1 ) and synexin ( anxa7 ) . 
background the prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> has reached epidemic proportions and is of great public health concern . 
a minor importance of esr2 on severe <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> cannot be excluded . 
conclusion esr1 gene alleles are unlikely to be a major cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in women . 
defining gene alleles that are associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> will contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind its development and potentially provide therapeutic targets . 
motor conduction velocity was normal despite clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> . 
though <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> is often triggered by life style , the importance of genetic predisposition has been clearly demonstrated [1 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> ) were detected by use of the indirect immmunofluorescence ( indirect immmunofluorescence ) technique using hep-2 cells fixed in alcohol as antigen substrate [15 ] . 
the sera were screened for <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> reactivity at a 1:2 0 dilution in pbs and the reaction visualised by a fitc conjugated fc-specific goat anti-dog igg ( cappel research products , durham , nc ) at dilution 1:60 . 
in this way , type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , impaired fasting glucose or <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired glucose tolerance <END> do not seem to be related to calpain 5 gene alleles , although the number of affected individuals is small ( 49 , 77 and 74 individuals respectively ) [see additional files 15 , 16 , 17 ] . 
however , weight <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> was also seen after an oral e . 
considering metabolic syndrome under de atpiii definition , we have found association with the <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> related aa-ca haplotype ( p = 0.029 , odds ratio = 1.8 0 [1.06 3.06] , n = 90) , although the global haplotypic effect is not significant ( p = 0.166 ) . 
formation of osseous tissue in soft tissues such as the lungs , eyes , arteries , or other organs is known as <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopic calcification <END> , dystrophic calcification , or ectopic ossification . 
this can be a symptom of <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperphosphatemia <END> . 
it has been shown recently that the stem cell factor ( stem cell factor ) and its receptor c-kit are present in both normal and <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> tissues , and that stem cell factor has no growth-promoting effect in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cells . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> ectopic calcification <END> is a pathologic deposition of calcium salts in tissues . 
they gradually gain some <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> and have <START:PHENOTYPE> fair skin <END> and blonde to white hair as adults with <START:PHENOTYPE> white eyebrows and eyelashes <END> . 
since all duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> patients experience a decrease in strength of limb and torso muscles , but only approximately one-third of dystrophic children suffer from <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairments <END> , it is believed that differences exist in the pathophysiolgical mechanisms between the central nervous system and muscle tissues [ , ] . 
young birds ( 4 8 weeks ) may have a brief period of <START:PHENOTYPE> anorexia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> after infection with e . 
primary mutational disorders of oxidative phosphorylation ( class i ) leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> ( leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> ) , the most common cause of male adolescent <START:PHENOTYPE> blindness <END> , is attributed to mutations in mitochondrial dna genes encoding subunits of complex i ( nadh dehydrogenase ( nd ) - alternatively termed nadh coq1 reductase ) . 
besides from the diarrhoea , the authors reported pronounced <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> and congestion in the abomasal mucosa , whereas in our material mild hyperaemia and <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> of the abomasal and intestinal mucosa occured only sporadically ( 2 cases of 28 ) . 
mri revealed a bifid spine below l1 , a <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid sacrum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> duplicated colon <END> , single right kidney , absent mullerian structures and excision of the mass with left colon resection and external genitalia reconstruction . 
discussion although the x-linked inherited disorder duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> ( duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> ) is primarily considered a muscle disease and most patients die of respiratory or <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac failure <END> , in a subpopulation of affected children non-progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> preceeds degeneration of the muscular system . 
unfortunately , most current thinking is based on the well-designed prospective cabg <START:PHENOTYPE> patch <END> trial[4 ] . 
after informed consent was obtained , individuals were examined with a particular emphasis on the presence of classical features associated with dyskeratosis congenita ( abnormal skin <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> , dystrophic fingernails , leukoplakia and <START:PHENOTYPE> early graying <END> of the hair) , and blood was drawn from a peripheral vein . 
the common missense substitution in nd1 that leads to leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> , ala52 thr , does not have as obvious an explanation for its effect . 
the varying dependence of mechanical failure regarding electrical activation might be fundamental to the understanding of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> refractory to resynchronization therapy [31 ] . 
in addition , the haplotype related to <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ( aa-ca ) is more frequent in individuals with metabolic syndrome ( atpiii criteria) , supporting the role of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> as an important underlying risk factor for cardiovascular diseases [31 ,32 ] . 
they also reported disturbances of pelt shift in all cases , and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> in one case , both changes that were not recognized in our material . 
as seen from table 1 and figure 1 , sti571 inhibited the growth of all tested <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cells in a dose-dependent manner . 
in addition , we associated several calpain 5 gene haplotypes with phenotypic differences observed between <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome patients , such as the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ( aa-ca ) and familial antecedents of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ( aa-ca and gg-cg ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> ( aa-ca and gg-cg ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> ( gg-ca ) . 
in that work , the gg-ca haplotype , associated with cholesterol levels in this work , was over-represented in <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome patients . 
since most human <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> tissues express pdgfr , sti571 might exert its function through this pathway in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cells . 
in a previous study , we analysed these four calpain 5 gene gene variants in <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome women , an anovulatory disorder of women in which <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> plays a central role [33 ] . 
the purpose of this study was to gain insight into the mechanisms of sti571 action in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cells , with special emphasis on receptor tyrosine kinase signaling . 
results determination of the gi50 concentration of sti571 in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cells to determine the gi50 concentration of sti571 , <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cells grown in 10 % fbs- containing medium were exposed to different doses of sti571 . 
presence of familial antecedents of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome women is a frequent finding ; 
the higher frequency of this haplotype among women with familial antecedents of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> suggested a hypertensive phenotype associated to this allele . 
however , in this study only moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> weight losses <END> were seen due to the parasite and only in the very young birds ( 1 3 weeks ) whereas the older birds apparently were able to compensate for the infection . 
galli have been reported to cause reductions in the growth rate , <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> and mortality in broilers [2 ,26 ,12 ,10 ] . 
thus , in contrast to dystrophic mdx and duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> skeletal muscle fibres , which show a greatly reduced expression of sarcolemmal -dystroglycan [ , , ] , this usually dystrophin-associated glycoprotein experiences a different fate during pathophysiological changes in the central nervous system of dystrophic mice . 
based on this lack of understanding of the exact neurobiology of duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> , we have performed here a comparative analysis of the expression of dystrophins and dystroglycans in brain and muscle tissues from animal models of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> . 
in all 3 studies , implantable cardioverter-defibrillator insertion resulted in improved survival over conventional medical therapy alone in patients with depressed left ventricular function and <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> , regardless of the status of revascularization . 
the mustt trial was another prospective randomized study evaluating the effect of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator insertion on patients with left ventricularejection fraction < 40% , <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> , and history of unsustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> with positive inducible <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> [6 ] . 
in addition , given the high prevalence of previous <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarctions <END> in this patient population , surgical revascularization cannot reverse areas of inhomogeneous <START:PHENOTYPE> scarring <END> . 
possibly cerebral or cerebellar hypermetabolism is involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairments <END> in certain duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> patients , but no consistent abnormalities are detectable in dystrophic brain tissues . 
these patients are at risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> from ventricular tachyarrhythmias and early insertion of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator should be strongly considered . 
duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> children accomplish performance tasks at a normal level , but their verbal intelligence quotient is significantly lower as compared to age-matched normal boys . 
the effectiveness of this drug in blocking bcr-abl and c-kit tyrosine kinases has led to food and drug administration ( food and drug administration ) approval for the treatment of philadelphia chromosome-positive <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic myelogenous leukemia <END> and c-kit-positive <START:PHENOTYPE> gastrointestinal stromal tumors <END> . 
it is possible that smaller sample size in <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome study , the effect of <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome phenotype or <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome related alleles have been acting as confounding factors . 
it occasionally occurs as cysts or fistulae in the skin or subcutaneous tissue , as remnants of the second branchial cleft ( ie , <START:PHENOTYPE> branchial cyst <END> ) or as sequestrated respiratory anlage from the primitive foregut ( ie , bronchiogenic cyst ) . 
in addition , expression of both pdgf and pdgf receptors ( pdgf receptors ) has been observed in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> . 
it is thought that these growth factors act in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner to stimulate <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> growth . 
human <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancers <END> overexpress a number of important tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors and their ligands , such as those belonging to the epidermal growth factor ( epidermal growth factor) , fibroblast growth factor ( fibroblast growth factor) , insulin-like growth factor ( igf-1 ) , and vascular endothelial growth factor ( vepidermal growth factor ) families . 
background intermediate syndrome ( intermediate syndrome ) is a major cause of death from <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> following acute organophosphate poisoning . 
magnetic resonance imaging has also shown promise in demonstrating pulmonary venous anatomy which is central to the technique of radiofrequency ablation of focal <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [ 19 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> ) accounts for 300,000 deaths in the united states , and the incidence of sudden cardiac death accounts for 0.1 0.2% of all deaths in the general population [12 ] . 
long-term survival nonetheless is hampered with a high incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> [2 ,3] . 
a new non-invasive technique for the characterization of time-dependent spectral properties of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> in the surface ecg using the wigner-ville distribution for time-frequency analysis and the cross wigner-ville to compute trends describing instantaneous frequency of the atrial activity has also been described . 
the absolute risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> increases with deteriorating left ventricular function and the ratio of sudden to non-sudden deaths is inversely related to the extent of functional impairment [14 ] . 
the risk further increases in patients with risk markers for <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> and post-myocardial infarction to approximately 35 % [6 ,13 ] . 
in addition , the role of this mismatch in the evolution of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> is largely unknown . 
mismatches between cardiac activation and motion propagation are of growing interest in the evaluation of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> patients who are candidates for resynchronization therapy . 
epstein et al . demonstrated the superiority of intracardiac echocardiography over fluoroscopy in treating <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [15 ] . 
in this retrospective review of patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction , implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in the post-operative period was shown to confer a survival advantage in patients with clinical evidence of non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> after coronary bypass surgery . 
it allows for assessment of wall contact of ablation catheters for creation of long linear lesions for catheter ablative treatment of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
electromechanical remodeling in the ischemic heart has probably fundamental differences to the process occurring in idiopathic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> . 
intermediate syndrome was diagnosed in ten out of 78 patients using a priori clinical diagnostic criteria , and five of them developed <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> . 
thus , although pdgf-mediated growth pathways do not seem to play a role in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> , the above data demonstrate the ability of sti571 to interfere with other growth-stimulatory signaling pathways , such as epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor-2 . 
in patients with type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , who are known to have a 2- to 4-fold increased risk for coronary heart disease ( coronary heart disease) , plasma homocysteine level seems to predict cardiovascular events ( 8 12 ) . 
conclusions characteristic changes in repetitive nerve stimulation , preceding the development of intermediate syndrome , help to identify a subgroup of patients at high risk of developing <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> . 
thirty patients developed forme fruste intermediate syndrome with less severe <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> not progressing to <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> whose repetitive nerve stimulation was characterized by decrement-increment or a combination of decrement-increment and repetitive fade but never severe decrements . 
severe decrement preceded <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> in four patients . 
among the symptoms are lightened <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> , which is attributed to reduced melanin synthesis resulting from the action of excess phenylalanine as a competitive inhibitor with tyrosine in the tyrosinase reaction , and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental deficiency <END> which is thought to be due to the harmful effects of excess phenylalanine and/or phenylpyruvate on the developing nervous system of the infant ( knox 1960 ) ; other clinical features include agitated behavior , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkinesis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tremors <END> , and epileptiform <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> . 
weight <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> as a result of tracheal e . 
~5 lung cancer ( a549 cell line)2 3 <START:PHENOTYPE> colorectal cancer <END> ( ht29) 6 cml ( k562 cell lines) 0.56 sti571 plasma levels 0.17 5.68mechanism of sti 571 action on <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cells in the next set of experiments , we evaluated the contribution of cytotoxic and cytostatic components to sti571 -induced growth inhibition . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> reduced phenylalanine hydroxylase activity <END> and high serum phenylalanine levels are also found in the human hereditary disease phenylketonuria . 
therefore , increasing concentration of growth factors in serum increased the resistance of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cells to sti571 . 
in contrast to established changes in the expression of dystrophins and utrophins in dystrophic brain , relatively little is known about the fate of dystrophin/utrophin-associated glycoproteins in human duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> brain . 
overall , approximately three-quarters of the patients in each group had a previous history of <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> , and slightly over half of these patients had a mi within 3 weeks of cabg surgery ( table 3 ) . 
in contrast to mdx brain , duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> patient specimens appear to exhibit a reduction in -dystroglycan levels [ , ] . 
prevalence of other <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> was similar between the 2 groups with <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> dominating in the post-operative period ( table 2 ) . 
however , representative surveys of large patient populations with a varying degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> have not yet been performed making it difficult to compare findings from genetic animal models with patient data . 
studies are warranted to define the role of activation and motion propagation in the definition of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> and cardiac remodeling . 
radiofrequency catheter ablation of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> treatment of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> using radiofrequency techniques can be curative or palliative . 
results presented in figure 2 demonstrate that sti571exerted potent toxic effects towards <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cells : 33.7 16 .5 % in mia-paca-2 and 26.8 % 16 .5 % in t3m4 cultures as compared to 10.7% 2.5 % and 5.7% 2.8 % in control cultures , respectively ( p < 0.05 ) . 
the exact mechanisms of the sti571 -induced toxicity towards pancreatic tumor cells remain to be determined effects of sti571 on growth factor-induced proliferation of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cells <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> is characterized by profound disturbances of growth factor signaling pathways . 
therefore , we next investigated which particular pathway can be inhibited by sti571 in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell lines . 
third , we performed cell cycle analysis of sti571 -treated <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell lines , which did not reveal any significant changes in the cell cycle pattern after 48 hours of incubation when compared to untreated cells . 
we have not found evidence of association of calpain 5 gene alleles with abdominal <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> estimated by waist circumference [see additional file 2 ] . 
they preceded the detection of <START:PHENOTYPE> azotemia <END> and isosthenuria by several days in <START:PHENOTYPE> acute renal failure <END> and by up to several years in slowly developing chronic renal diseases . 
background the aim of this study was to compare the tissue distribution and pathogenicity of three virulence variants of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus ( classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus ) and to investigate the applicability of various conventional diagnostic procedures . 
in <START:PHENOTYPE> rhabdomyolysis <END> large amounts of myoglobin can also be passed into urine . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> may occur with glomerular disease , pyuria or , transiently , follow exercise [15 ] . 
in cases with <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> or thoracic radiograph abnormalities , it is valuable to rule in or out cardiac muscle injury in order to optimize the treatment . 
in this study , we sought to extend the profile of sti571 applications , and tested its effects in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell lines . 
case report a 55 year old gentleman underwent emergency ascending aortic replacement and aortic valve repair ( valve resuspension ) for a type a <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic dissection <END> . 
the sti571 target c-kit and its ligand stem cell factor ( stem cell factor ) have been shown to be expressed in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cells . 
the patient underwent aortic valve replacement for severe <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic regurgitation <END> 8 months after repair of type a <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic dissection <END> plus aortic valve resuspension .

he made an excellent recovery following this procedure and postoperative transthoracic echocardiogram ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) showed mild <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic valve regurgitation <END> . 
it has been shown that stem cell factor has no significant effects on <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell growth , whereas sti571 inhibits <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell growth . 
a transthoracic echocardiogram repeated 4 weeks later showed presence of moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic valve regurgitation <END> . 
for example , sti571 can inhibit pdgf-mediated growth and leads to the apoptosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> cells in vitro by selective inhibition of the pdgfr tyrosine kinase . 
the mapping of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> has helped clarify its mechanism and localize possible anatomical sites for effective radiofrequency ablation . 
conclusion results obtained from our analysis in <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome women and this population-based study suggest that calpain 5 gene is a gene related to metabolic syndrome and related phenotypes such as <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> , at least in the spanish population . 
these results are in accordance with the evidence of linkage of type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> within the chromosomal region that contains calpain 5 gene gene reported by silander et al . 
statistical analysis all analyses were performed using the sas computer software ( version 9.1 , sas institute , <START:PHENOTYPE> cary <END> , nc , usa ) . 
[13 ] showed that patients with type-2 diabetic <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> and microalbuminuria had increased activity of urinary mmp-9 when s-creatinine and bun concentrations were still normal . 
still , cardiac troponin i analysis has been demonstrated to be useful in identifying myocardial injury in human <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> patients without overt cardiac disease [38 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> was entered as dependent variable with ntriglycerides = 0 and htriglycerides = 1 . 
[14 ] showed that in rats kidney tissue mmp-2 activity increased two- to threefold in days 1 to 3 after ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> acute renal failure <END> and mmp-9 activity increased two- to threefold in days 2 to 3 . 
in dogs cystatin-c concentration seemed to correlate with s-creatinine concentrations in <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic renal failure <END> , although that correlation was not as good with volume-depleted dogs [12 ] . 
background classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> ( classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> ) is a highly contagious viral disease of swine and wild boars , causing severe economic losses mainly in countries with dense pig populations . 
gradual failure of the aortic valve repair to resuspend the valve was speculated to be the likely cause of significant <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic regurgitation <END> . 
however , cardiac catheterisation was performed at 8 months which revealed severe <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic regurgitation <END> , systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 51 mmhg and <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> . 
at this stage there was no change in the degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic regurgitation <END> . 
the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor sti571 , which has been effective in cml as well as <START:PHENOTYPE> gist <END> , is a selective inhibitor of abl , pdgf and c-kit receptor tyrosine kinases . 
deregulation of those signaling pathways is frequent during <START:PHENOTYPE> malignant transformation <END> . 
to summarize , <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cells , resistant to growth induction through sti571 -sensitive c-kit and pdgf pathways , were still responsive to the inhibitory effects of sti571 , although at high gi50 concentrations . 
results this survey reports such an analysis for 15 missense mutations , one insertion and three deletions involved in leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> , leigh syndrome , mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy , mohr-tranebjaerg syndrome , iron-storage disorders related to friedreich 's <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , and hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> spastic paraplegia <END> . 
thus , immunohistochemistry provides simple and sensitive tools for the prompt detection of newly emerging variants of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus , including the viruses of very mild virulence . 
focal <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> arising from both right atrium and pulmonary veins has been successfully ablated using this system [14 ] . 
a three-step process of establishing geometry , identifying the area of interest and navigating the ablation catheter to this area is used to map and treat <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> . 
the comparative studies revealed remarkable differences in the onset of clinical signs as well as in the development of the macro- and microscopical changes , and in the tissue distribution of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus in the three experimental groups . 
these variables included past surgical history , previous <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> ) , presence of co-morbidities , smoking status , body mass index ( bmyocardial infarction ) and new york heart association dyspnoea grade [45 ] . 
since htriglycerides is considered as a risk factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> in asian indians , there is an urgent need to evaluate the association of apolipoproteinc3 ssti polymorphism with the risk of developing <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> in asian indians . 
this is an important finding as asian indians are highly sensitive to the adverse effects of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> , the risk of which is likely to increase manifold with growing shift towards affluent lifestyle and sedentary habits in larger fraction of our population . 
in our study significant weight <START:PHENOTYPE> depressions <END> were seen in the orally infected chickens , which indicates that a . 
potential life-threatening consequences of pyometra include endotoxaemia , bacteraemia , septicaemia , systemic inflammatory response syndrome , <START:PHENOTYPE> disseminated intravascular coagulation <END> , multiple organ dysfunctions and disseminated bacterial infection of vital organs [2 ,21,29] . 
in fact , the finding of <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal glucose homeostasis <END> in the knockout mice for fem1b gene , the identification of a germline missense mutation in fem1a gene in a <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome patient and the observation of fem1a being downregulated in human <START:PHENOTYPE> rhabdomyosarcoma <END> cell lines , support this hypothesis [8 ,9 ,39 ] . 
regarding <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , calpains have been involved in mitochondrial mechanisms of oxidative stress that leads to vascular dysfunction which causes <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic hypertension <END> and compensatory cardiac stiffness and diastolic <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> [38 ] . 
in conclusion , the diagnosis of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery should be considered in adults without evidence of ischemic heart disease presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> , left sided <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> with or without mitral valve dysfunction , since an early diagnosis and surgical treatment generally results in an excellent prognosis . 
recent work by jalife and colleagues questions the randomness of atrial activity in <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [10 ] . 
with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> refractory to these treatment options , direct surgical ablation or resection of the arrhythmogenic focus is an option icd implantation may also be considered in patients without a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> , when there is marked left ventricular dysfunction and electrophysiological study shows inducible <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> ( primary prophylaxis ) [15 ] . 
recent studies in isolated human atrial preparations showed that a single meandering functional reentrant wavefront produced <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [9 ] . 
thus , at a certain rate , organized atrial activity can disintegrate into <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> provided the critical tissue mass is available to sustain it . 
the present understanding is that <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> requires a critical atrial mass needed to maintain the <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> and that there is a critical rate above which organized atrial activity cannot continue [8 ] . 
as in other patients with a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> / <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> not associated to an acute ischemic event , antiarrhythmic treatment must be considered . 
allessie et al . offered several possible explanations : a stable background circuit capable of initiating new <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> when the earlier episode dies out , abnormal focal trigger sites in the atria and the possibility of an echo beat from the atrioventricular node or from an accessory pathway . 
thus , s2 allele may serve as a significant risk marker for susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> . 
restoration of a dual coronary system will prevent further ischemia and <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> of acute ischemic origin , but the anatomical substrate for ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> in patients with old <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarctions <END> will not be altered after revascularization . 
all these theories of random reentry wavelets explained the sustenance of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> once it occurred , but an explanation of its initiation was also warranted . 
icd implantation has been shown to be superior to drug treatment in patients with a history of <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> / <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> and previous <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarctions <END> ( secondary prophylaxis ) especially when there is left ventricular dysfunction [14 ] . 
ours is the first study on asian indians to report a strong association of apolipoproteinc3s2 allele with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> in indians . 
in the 1970s , allessie introduced the concept of leading circle reentry . in a goat model of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> , he demonstrated that the average circuit diameter was 20 - 30 mm and that a minimum of 5-8 random wavelets were required to sustain atrial fibrillation at any given time . 
the logistic analysis revealed that individuals carrying s2 allele were 3.2 times more prone to develop <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> as compared to s1s1 . 
post-surgical complications such as <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrhythmias <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> and infections were also recorded . 
the following sections discuss how the above discoveries have channeled catheter therapy for <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
the late outcome after revascularization mainly depends on the extend of irreversible <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> and the presence of myocardial scar tissue . 
mapping <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> the discussion of evolution of catheter techniques would be impossible without inclusion of the development of mapping techniques [13 ] . 
clinical signs varied from mild discomfort to heavy <START:PHENOTYPE> sweating <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> restlessness <END> . 
simultaneous correction of the <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve insufficiency <END> can be performed , but conservative treatment is often recommended as mitral valve function improves spontaneously . 
three of the horses had been painful for about 12 hours before the operation started ( small intestine <START:PHENOTYPE> volvulus <END> , right dorsal displacement and left dorsal displacement ) , one horse for 24 hours ( with small intestine impaction ) and one horse had been colicky for 72 hours before the operation ( right dorsal displacement ) . 
this region only includes the gene that codifies b3gn-t6 , a member of the n-acetylglucosaminyl transferase protein family related to <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophies <END> , neoplastic disorders and altered glucose homeostasis , although b3gn-t6 has never been analysed in humans [45 ] . 
the question of randomness of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> is also not settled at present . 
thus there appears to be a role for both reentry and focal activity in the electrophysiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
treatment modalities aim at elimination of both mechanisms underlying <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
the likelihood that focal activation plays some role in <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> is now well accepted . 
subjects having angina or any history of <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> were excluded from the study . 
in addition to motion analysis , myocardial <START:PHENOTYPE> scarring <END> could be identified using delayed hyper-enhancement mri . 
haissaguerre et al . reported arrhythmogenicity of the pulmonary veins as possible focal triggers in some cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [12 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> contracture <END> and altered biomechanics , the net result being limited functional ability . 
sporadic cases have been reported in which patients affected by congenital junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac failure <END> developed <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> or faster <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> ( up to 400 beats/min ) during progressive digoxin loading [2 ] . 
digoxin did not affect ventricular rate in any patients and has been demonstrated to be not completely safe in patients with congenital junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> . 
evidence suggests that therapy can improve functional possibilities for children with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral palsy <END> but is inconclusive as to which approach might be most beneficial . 
the pharmacological treatment of junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> is hampered by a high rate of failures . 
introduction <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> ) is one of the most common <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> seen in clinical practice . 
twin studies using discordant twins affected with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> show that spatial working memory , divided attention , choice reaction time and selective attentionand attentional set-shiftingare underlain by inherited factors . 
the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> increases with age and is seen in up to 8 .9% of individuals greater than 80 years of age [1 ] . 
although many treatment modalities are available for <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> , curative therapy has recently become possible for some patients with atrial fibrillaton . 
children with attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder ( attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder ) exhibit abnormal performance in sustained attention tasksand studies on <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> reveal slowed covert orienting of visual spatial attention . 
personal experience has shown that in those cases not responding to a single drug regimen , as association of antiarrhythmic agents with different electrophysiological effects ( amiodarone + a ic antiarrhythmic drug ) may control otherwise untreatable congenital junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> . 
however , propafenone has been shown to result particularly effective in preventing or controlling the <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> only in patients with lower heart rate [6 ] other studies have also tested phenytoin , which was able to control ventricular rate but caused <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> , ajmaline , which intravenous infusion was followed by <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> and verapamil which caused cardiovascular collapse [2 ] . 
this is partly due to the complexity and incomplete understanding of this <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> . 
however , in some cases it can not be excluded the potential proarrhythmic effect of the drugs used to control the <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> [15 ] . 
this article will briefly review the understanding of the mechanisms of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> and then the evolution of catheter techniques for control and elimination of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
in other cases it can not be excluded that a pharmacological treatment can be responsible of the <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> of ventricular excitability , leading to a slow unsatisfactory <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular escape rhythm <END> in case of av block and <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> . 
mechanisms of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> the understanding of mechanisms underlying the initiation and maintenance of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> has evolved over the last many decades . 
pharmacological therapies for the management of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> have many limitations such as side effects , cost , inconvenience , breakthrough <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> , drug-drug interactions and continued need for anticoagulation . 
in our series , two patients developed symptomatic non-sustained life-threatening <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> as a spontaneous desincronization of junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> , due to a proarrhythmic effect of the combination of used drugs ( amiodarone + propafenone and amiodarone + flecainide ) [6 ] . 
an improved understanding of the pathophysiology and electrophysiologic basis of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> coupled with the availability of better mapping techniques as well as advances in catheter technology offer promise for curative treatment . 
in other cases the <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> has been attributed to extensive abnormalities involving the whole atrio-ventricular junction [13 ] or to an intra-his bundle tumour originating from purkinje cells [14 ] . 
scherf in 1947 revived the theory of focal trigger in <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [5 ] . 
the work of moe in 1960s supported the theory of randomly propagating multiple wavelets as the main mechanism underlying <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [6 ] . 
the patient was not assuming therapy at the time of the onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> complete heart block <END> . 
the earliest concept of reentry was proposed by winterberg in 1906 [2 ] and lewis in 1912 advocated that rapid focal activity from one or more centers accounted for <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [3 ] . 
henneveld reported a case of an 8 months old girl affected by a rapid ventricular rate junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> , who developed two years later a <START:PHENOTYPE> complete heart block <END> with rapidly increasing left ventricular end diastolic diameter [10 ] . 
statistics all statistical analyses were performed using a statistical programme ( jmp v 5. 0 , sas , <START:PHENOTYPE> cary <END> , usa ) . 
the reentrant wavelet hypothesis required the concept of wavelength of the <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> circuit to be introduced . 
the management of infants with slow junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> ( less than 150 beats/min ) without symptoms appear to be debated . 
finally , a humanized interleukin-6 receptor antibody , tocilizumab , has been developed and successfully used in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> [98 ] . 
a significant proportion of patients could not tolerate the drug due to <START:PHENOTYPE> nausea <END> and gastrointestinal symptoms . 
other studies using endophenotypic measures of attention have linked variation in the chrna7gene with sensorimotor gating performance and variation in the drd4gene with <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficits <END> . 
it has been reported a case in which an asymptomatic patient at birth with junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> with a ventricular rate of 140 beats/min returned at 6 weeks of age in cardiovascular collapse due to a ventricular rate of 300 beats/min [2 ] . 
the minimum circuit wavelength as defined by the <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> wavelength is the product of the tissue refractory period and wavefront conduction velocity . 
in a multicenter study , villain reports a familiar history of junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> positive in 5 0 % of the children . 
familiar occurrence even more interest is attributed to this <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> by the fact that it is a familiar condition . 
the possible endotoxaemia and reduced food intake may have contributed to the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> , but in our opinion it is unlikely that they were sufficient to cause such a severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> . 
[9 ] reported the development of junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> after catheter ablation of persistent junctional reciprocating <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> in one patient , but a differentiation between a masking effect of the latter <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> on junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> and a procedure related genesis of junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> itself could not be argued . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> causing clinical signs in adult horses is a rare occurrence , but has previously been described in association with tumours . 
the exact mechanism related to death in congenital junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> is still unclear . 
outcome congenital junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> is hampered by high mortality , with up to 34% mortality rate . 
endotoxaemia may induce hyper- or <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> [15 ] . 
in our experience up to three members of the same family ( 2 sisters , 1 cousin ) were affected by junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> with a family history of junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> recognised in up to 55 .6 % of the patients [6 ] . 
most are sudden death , that has been found also in children with " well compensated " <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> [2 ] . 
one pony had a <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic islet adenoma <END> which was associated with hyperinsulinism causing <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> [3 ] . 
haplotype association analysis of calpain 5 gene gene with <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> estimated using the homeostasis model assessment method ( homeostasis model assessment method ) using thesias software . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> in horses has previously been reported in association with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal carcinoma <END> [4 ,6] , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> [7 ] and <START:PHENOTYPE> peritoneal mesothelioma <END> [5 ] without a definite cause being established . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> in association with tumours is well recognised in man and dogs , and gastrointestinal stromal tumour and <START:PHENOTYPE> leiomyosarcomas <END> causing <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> have been described in both species [1 ,16 ] . 
tumours may cause <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> by different mechanisms ; 
patients can present with <START:PHENOTYPE> enophthalmos <END> , lash loss , lid induration or tightening , <START:PHENOTYPE> periorbital edema <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal opacities <END> and thickening , <START:PHENOTYPE> keratoconjunctivitis sicca <END> , fornix shortening , ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> or palsy , <START:PHENOTYPE> iritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> iris atrophy <END> and heterochromia , <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal hemorrhages <END> [3 ] . 
other connective tissue disorders , lipoid dystrophies may accompany linear <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> . 
in humans , events reported in the induction of myocard injury include reduction in oxygen supply in combination with increased myocard oxygen consumption or increasing wall stress , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> with left wall hypertrophy , <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> , infiltrative diseases , cardiac trauma , <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary embolism <END> or myocardial toxins as a consequence of <START:PHENOTYPE> sepsis <END> [29] . 
mature sympathetic neurons cultured from adult animals respond to bmp-7 with enhanced dendritic growth , and treatment with bmp-7 enhances recovery in animal models of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> . 
an ivory colored , band-like <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> (en coup de sabre ) of the frontoparietal region is characteristic . 
probably , the dramatic clinical course of these patients is the extreme expression of the pathological process occurring in the his bundle region , causing junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> in a first time and finally the complete loss of av conduction . 
prenatal diagnosis of junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> has been also reported , with the superior vena cava/ascending aorta doppler echocardiography approach [4 ] . 
conclusion this case indicates that gastrointestinal stromal tumour may cause <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> in the horse . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> movement disorder <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral palsy <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral palsy <END> ) is expressed in a variety of ways and to varying degrees in each individual . 
nude mice bearing growing mda-mb-231 human <START:PHENOTYPE> breast carcinoma <END> xenografts were then divided into four dietary groups (2 0 mice per group ) such that the mean tumor size was not different between groups . 
electrophysiological mechanism electrophysiological mechanism of junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> is thought to be abnormal automaticity within the his bundle [7 ] . 
one case report investigated the level of insulin-like growth factor 2 in a horse with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal cell carcinoma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> , but the data were inconclusive [4 ] . 
doppler wave showed av dissociation with aortic ejection occurring at smaller interval than venous retrograde flow due to atrial contractions and " a " waves occurring at a very short interval after aortic ejection , during periods of 1 :1 av relationship <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> . 
the plasma level of insulin-like growth factor 2 was not measured in the current case , and the exact mechanism causing <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> was not determined . 
possible explanations for non islet cell <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> has been proposed to be the catabolism of the tumour lowering blood glucose , secretion of substances which have insulin-like effect , interference with liver function and suppression of counterregulatory hormones [2 ] . 
junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> typically presents a " warming-up " phase at its onset and a " cooling-down " phase at its termination . 
in some species overt insulin-like growth factor 2 ( insulin-like growth factor 2 ) is thought to cause <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoglycemia <END> [16 ,17 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> is not inducible by programmed stimulation in baseline status , but can be elicited after sympathetic stimulation with isoproterenol . 
when there is retrograde conduction , adenosine infusion can rule out the diagnosis of av reciprocating <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> , because of tachycardia cycle lengthening without termination of the <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> [8 ] . 
junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> can coexist with the occurrence of other types of <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> . 
programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation usually are not able to terminate <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> , that can be only transiently suppressed by atrial and/or ventricular pacing , exhibiting a resetting curve-response to extrastimuli during <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> . 
many <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric disorders <END> whose anatomical origins may not be well understood also show deficits in attention . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> and lack of fitness ; 
for example , patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> exhibit difficulties in sensorimotor gating , smooth pursuit eye-tracking , set-shifting , and working memory tasks . 
for example , <START:PHENOTYPE> strokes <END> to the posterior parietal lobe involved in orienting produce neglect of the contralesional space and specific deficits in tasks involved the orienting network . 
impairments present in children with <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral palsy <END> as a direct result of the brain injury or occurring indirectly to compensate for underlying problems include abnormal muscle tone ; 
multiple organ dysfunctions and <START:PHENOTYPE> coagulopathies <END> such as <START:PHENOTYPE> disseminated intravascular coagulation <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> disseminated intravascular coagulation <END> ) are other severe complications that can induce myocard injury [21] . 
lesions in the cell bodies of dopamine (dopamine ) neuronsas well as in the terminals located in prefrontal cortex result in <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive deficits <END> in executive function tasks . 
in the case where <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrhythmia <END> was discovered by auscultation on the first day post surgery , the cardiac troponin i levels were very high at that point in time ( 18 0 g l-1 ) , indicative of severe myocardial injury . 
in a recent study , single nucleotide adiponectin polymorphisms (single nucleotide adiponectin polymorphisms ) were studied in 70 nonobese , nondiabetic , normolipidemic nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease patients , and 70 healthy controls . 
interestingly , it was shown that two at-risk adiponectin single nucleotide adiponectin polymorphisms ( 45tt and 276gt ) were significantly more prevalent in nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease than in the general population , and that they were associated with severity of liver disease independently of adiponectin serum levels [83 ] . 
two smaller studies , however , yielded contradictory results , as they found that hepatic expressions of adiponectin mrna and adipor2 receptor were significantly lower in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients compared with patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> [81 , 82 ] . 
in the last decade , discussion on positional preference leading to deformational <START:PHENOTYPE> plagiocephaly <END> (deformational <START:PHENOTYPE> plagiocephaly <END> ) has increased substantially . 
however , since the <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairment <END> in duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> is non-progressive and exhibits great variations between individual patients , only a sub-population of brain cells may be affected by this pathophysiological mechanism . 
background triglyceride and high density lipoprotein ( high density lipoprotein ) cholesterol are important components in <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> syndrome and are considered as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases . 
there were no <START:PHENOTYPE> pupillary abnormalities <END> or restriction of extra-ocular movements . 
deletions in the exon 45-52 region of the duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> gene have been reported to be associated with an increased incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive abnormalities <END> . 
differential diagnosis from <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> was often described [24 , 33 , 36 , 51 ] . 
atherogenic dyslipidemia , including <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are the targets for primary prevention by lifestyle intervention in adult treat panel iii guidelines . 
thus , probably a combination of different primary genetic defects in the duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> gene and variations in compensatory mechanisms result in the different degrees of mental insufficiencies in dystrophic children . 
a relatively high number of hits found during a search in january 2008 within pubmed resulted in the following : asymmetry ( 811 ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> plagiocephaly <END> (206 ) , torticollis ( 225) , posture (405 ) , and <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ( 623 ) . 
the measurement of high molecular weight adiponectin levels , which are thought to better correlate with <START:PHENOTYPE> steatosis <END> than the total adiponectin levels [79 ] and the validation of these markers in larger cohorts would be crucial steps towards the widespread use of these biomarker panels . 
the linear scar on her forehead , which was first discarded as an innocuous finding actually alludes to the early features in linear <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> , called "en coup de sabre " . 
these results , in contrast to the previous study , put the telomere shortening observed in individuals with 5p into proportion , indicating that telomere shortening in individuals with 5p syndrome , although significant , is minimal and that the majority of telomere lengths of individuals with 5p syndrome still <START:PHENOTYPE> fall <END> within the distribution of normal telomere lengths ( 5th 95th percentile , see fig . 3a ) . 
in another study comprising of 66 patients with early non-alcoholic steatohepatitis stages ( brunt 1-2 ) and 19 with simple <START:PHENOTYPE> steatosis <END> , the combined evaluation of serum adiponectin , homeostasis model assessment for <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , and serum collagen type iv had 94 % sensitivity and 74 % specificity for the prediction of early non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [77 ] . 
the authors found that the combined use of adiponectin and homeostasis model assessment for <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> ( homeostasis model assessment for <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> ) for differentiating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis from <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> had an area under the curve value of 0.79 . 
tumor bearing mice that consumed n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids gained more weight prior to doxorubicin therapy than mice that did not receive n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids indicating that tumor induced <START:PHENOTYPE> cachexia <END> was reduced . 
attempting to set a discriminating adiponectin level , they found that 77 % of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis had adiponectin <1 0 g/ml and homeostasis model assessment for <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> >3 , compared to 33% of patients with simple <START:PHENOTYPE> steatosis <END> . 
furthermore , important steps have been taken towards its use as a noninvasive marker for the differentiation between nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis . 
hui et al . showed that adiponectin was significantly reduced in subjects with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis compared to age , bmi , and sex matched healthy controls or compared to patients with simple <START:PHENOTYPE> steatosis <END> [76 ] . 
results have been more promising with adiponectin , as its levels are lower in patients with nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis than controls [75 ] . 
the significantly higher body weight gain is likely due to reduced tumor related <START:PHENOTYPE> cachexia <END> . 
thus , the lack in brain dystrophins does not necessarily lead to a loss in all associated glycoproteins and possibly abnormal oligomerization of the brain dystrophin might play a role in the molecular pathogenesis of abnormal brain functions in <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> . 
the tumor growth curves ( figure 1 ) illustrate the significant enhancement of the efficacy of doxorubicin against mda-mb 231 human <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> xenografts when fish oil concentrate was incorporated in the diet . 
the cumulative effect of telomere shortening over several generations also explains why even a minimal impairment of telomerase activity will eventually lead to telomeres sufficiently <START:PHENOTYPE> short to <END> cause disease . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> enophthalmos <END> greater than 2 mm relative to the other eye creates an observable cosmetic deformity [2 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> enophthalmos <END> is defined as the relative recession ( backward +/- downward displacement ) of the globe into the bony orbit [1 ] . 
however , the different <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> reactivity does not exclude the possibility that the breed is affected by different immune-mediated diseases or the theory that the disorder indicates a common genetic and/or immunological disturbance , giving rise to different kinds of autoantibody production . 
the majority of the dogs display <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positivity and an improvement of signs when put on corticosteroid treatment . 
consequently , significant improvement in the postoperative course such as less mechanical ventilation , less catecholamines and iabp usage , less icu and hospital stay , less <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> , less need for hemodyalisis and most importantly less hospital mortality was observed in patients operated hybrid-pump . 
linear <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> is characterized by localized fibrosis of skin , blood vessels , subcutaneous fat , muscle and sometimes bone . 
localised <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> presents in three clinical forms : generalised , morphoea ( atrophic and sclerotic skin lesions ) , and linear <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> [3 ,4] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> may occur as a systemic disease or as a localised form [3 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> is a systemic or localised disease . 
therapeutic implications as it has been clearly elucidated , adipokines are key players in the pathogenesis and progression of nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease . 
body weight and tumor growth rate it has been reported that omega 3 fatty acids can decrease tumor <START:PHENOTYPE> cachexia <END> . 
oligonucleotide arrays were synthesized on 1 3-inch glass slides with ink-jet technology using mrna samples obtained from clontech ( palo alto , ca ) and the cell lines jurkat ( t lymphocyte , atcc no . tib-152 ) and k562 ( <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic myelogenous leukemia <END> , atcc no . ccl-243 ) . 
in nineties radiofrequency catheter ablation technique was able to control the <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> with the preservation of the normal av conduction [9 ] . 
radiofrequency catheter ablation of junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> was reported for the first time in the eighties [22,23] . 
interestingly , some individuals with 5p showed ridged fingernails and <START:PHENOTYPE> early graying <END> of their hair , a clinical manifestation associated with premature aging . 
conclusions since junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> therapy relay on different medical options , a staged treatment protocol is advisable : a pharmacological approach should be tested and carried on , also with a multi drug treatment , while catheter ablation can be a definitive option in critically ill patients , when drugs fail or when <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> becomes chronic and the patient is dependent on a potentially toxic therapy . 
similarly , individuals with 5p syndrome had low numbers of circulating peripheral blood progenitor cells compared to normal controls , which is suggestive for <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> . 
walsh suggested to evaluate av conduction with transesophageal electrophysiological test in all patients with congenital junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> and consider pacemaker insertion only if impaired conduction can be demonstrated by atrial stimulation , or by the observation of spontaneous av block on ecg and holter monitoring [25] . 
supplementary material additional fin the radiation field1 a list of groups that support patients , families , and clinicians caring for patients with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome . 
in the multicenter study [2 ] most part of patients did not undergo to pacemaker implantation , but four patients with well compensated junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> died suddenly and in one of those a slow ventricular rate was recorded during the terminal event . 
blood progenitor cells with shorter telomeres stop dividing or die leading to the <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> in individuals with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita . 
introduction <START:PHENOTYPE> enophthalmos <END> is an important physical sign which can be easily missed . 
lower copy numbers of this mutation ( ~ 70% ) are associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> retinitis pigmentosa <END> ( narp ) whereas high copy numbers ( >90% ) give rise to leigh syndrome . 
this scar is a feature of linear <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> and called "en coup de sabre " . 
retinol-binding protein 4 serum levels were higher both in diabetic and nondiabetic nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease patients compared to controls , but no liver biopsy was performed and , therefore , histological correlations were not available [91 ] . 
finally , serum interleukin-6 was found significantly elevated in nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease than controls , even after correction for age , sex , and bmi [90 ] . 
conclusion <START:PHENOTYPE> enophthalmos <END> is defined as the relative recession of the globe into the bony orbit and if measuring greater than 2 mm can give a noticeable cosmetic deformity . 
the potential role of different adipokines in nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease is summarized in table 1 . 
finally , although serum visfatin was lower in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis than nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease patients and healthy controls , it was not independently associated with presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [86] , while its levels positively correlated with portal inflammation [92 ] . 
in a smaller study of 45 nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease patients and 50 controls , serum tumour necrosis factor-a but not resistin was independently associated with fibrosis in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [86 ] . 
on the other hand , resistin levels were associated with fibrosis severity in a recent study from our group [73 ] , while serum resistin levels were higher in nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease than controls and positively correlated with liver inflammation in an italian study [87 ] . 
in a study of 80 ethnic chinese patients with nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease , serum resistin levels were associated neither with presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis nor with its severity [85 ] . 
in a study of 36 morbidly obese patients and 12 healthy controls , interleukin-6 was an independent predictor of <START:PHENOTYPE> steatosis <END> and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [89 ] . 
regarding the remaining cytokines , data is yet scarce and confined to small patient numbers . interleukin-6 has gained attention lately , after a small study of 35 patients ( non-alcoholic steatohepatitis : 18 , nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease : 10 , controls : 7) , in which interleukin-6 liver expression was markedly increased in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients and positively correlated with inflammation and fibrosis [88 ] . 
recently dorman et al . have described a protective effect of magnesium supplementation on junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> in paediatric patients undergoing surgery for <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defects <END> [21] . 
this could be due to the stabilization of the membrane potential and the reduction of the automaticity , resulting in a low rate of development of the <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> . 
further studies are needed to evaluate the potential role of magnesium in the treatment of the congenital form of junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> is a frequent complication of junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> with high ventricular rate and its management is even more difficult . 
isoproterenol , dopamine , dobutamine and amrinone all increase the junctional ectopic <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> rate . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> early graying <END> of hair was not seen in individuals with 5p syndrome and with two copies of telomerase reverse transcriptase , but all three were below the age of 10 . 
the two common pathogenic mutations in nd6 ( met64 val and ala72 val ) lead to a less severe and a very severe form of leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> , respectively . 
our analysis demonstrates that within one generation , telomeres do not become sufficiently <START:PHENOTYPE> short to <END> cause disease or contribute to the 5p phenotype . 
sodium nitroprusside has to be avoided too , since <START:PHENOTYPE> low blood pressure <END> will reflexly increase adrenergic tone . 
linear <START:PHENOTYPE> scleroderma <END> has the following features-localised fibrosis of the skin , blood vessels , subcutaneous fat , muscle and sometimes bone . 
in one case cautery surgical ablation led to the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> . 
distinction between the various causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> enophthalmos <END> can be difficult . 
in our own studies , where the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> was used as a clinical sign of intestinal anaphylaxis in orally challenged ovalbumin sensitized hooded-lister rats , frequent piloerection was observed . 
introduction <START:PHENOTYPE> enophthalmos <END> is a subtle , frequently missed but important physical sign that can and should be accurately diagnosed . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> lymphopenia <END> and increased acute phase proteins may also be seen in connection with treatment with corticosteroids . 
further structural study of complex i will be required to explain how this mutation contributes to leber 's hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> optic neuropathy <END> . 
ophthalmic effects include <START:PHENOTYPE> enophthalmos <END> , lash loss , lid induration or tightening and periorbital <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> . 
in a small study of 23 patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis , 21 with nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease and 18 controls , serum tumour necrosis factor-a and soluble tnuclear factor receptor 1 were significantly increased in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis compared to both nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease and controls [84 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> is reported both in man and dogs to be a common finding in certain systemic <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune diseases <END> , due to immune complex deposition in the glomeruli [6 ,12 ] . 
hui et al . showed that although tumour necrosis factor-a levels significantly differed between nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease and controls , no such difference existed between non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease [76 ] . 
in this study , urine analysis was performed for 17 diseased dogs and none of them showed <START:PHENOTYPE> proteinuria <END> , isosthenuria or any other sign of kidney disorder . 
conclusion airway inflammation , present in <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchitis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiectasis <END> , is characterised by the presence of activated inflammatory cells . 
a clinically silent <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> has been associated with embolic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> and has been proposed as a precipitating cause of brain abscess in otherwise healthy adults [3 ,9 ,10 ] . 
moreover , a functionally shut foramen ovale may open in healthy individuals during a valsava maneuver or in disease states that cause <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> ( e.g . <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> ) [8 ,9] . 
older studies have detected a <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> in a small fraction of healthy individuals [7 ,8 ] . 
nonetheless , <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> remains a significant cause of mortality in patients who undergo coronary artery bypass grafting with poor left ventricular function [3 ] . 
a total of 48 patients completed both phases of the study ( multisite stimulation in <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathies <END> sr ) . 
multisite stimulation in <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathies <END> trial the multisite stimulation in <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathies <END> ( multisite stimulation in <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathies <END> ) trial is a single-blind randomized , controlled crossover study involving 131 patients who were divided into two groups based upon their underlying rhythm [17- 19 ] . 
a pubmed search using the keywords " <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> " and " brain abscess " yielded 26 articles (2 0 jul 2007) , out of which nine described ten patients with brain abscess not explained otherwise than on a basis of a silent patent foramen ovale [3 ,10 ,11 ] . 
group one included 67 patients with new york heart association class iii <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> , qrs duration >15 0 ms with stable sinus rhythm and no conventional indications for pacemaker therapy [17 ] . 
however , one tolling retriever patient with clinical findings that fulfilled the inclusion criteria was found later on to have acute myeloid <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> , and consequently the dog was excluded from the study . 
in addition , fewer patients in the group assigned to cardiac resynchronization than control patients required hospitalization ( 8 percent vs . 15 percent ) or intravenous medications ( 7 percent vs . 15 percent ) for the treatment of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> ( p< 0.05 for both comparisons ) . 
implantation of the device was unsuccessful in 8 percent of patients and was complicated by refractory <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bradycardia <END> , or asystole in four patients ( two of whom died ) and by perforation of the coronary sinus requiring pericardiocentesis in two others . 
indication for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation was clinical evidence of non sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> ( non sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> ) . 
changes in the efficiency of the alerting network as a consequence of mood and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> are further supported by the findings of liotti and tucker where subjects induced into sadness showed no improvement in reaction time when given alerting cues before target stimuli were presented . 
the eye was becoming progressively more inflammed , with <START:PHENOTYPE> epiphora <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> and blurred visual acuity . 
studies on <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> and mood have shown deficits in simple reaction time tasks in patients that report sadness or <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> . 
however , previously it has not been documented to cause such a degree of swelling and inflammation of both the lids to warrant a diagnosis of preseptal <START:PHENOTYPE> cellulitis <END> . 
in family <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-1 , the analysis of marker <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-ca revealed full cosegregation between one allele (b ) of the dinucleotide repeat and the disease ( fig . 1 ) , which allowed to exclude one at-risk female ( iv9 ) of being a carrier . 
one of the reasons for this is that conventional oncological strategies , such as chemotherapy , radiotherapy , antihormonal modalities or systemic use of monoclonal antibodies , have not achieved significant improvement in the survival of <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> patients . 
the inflammation under the upper eyelid may be sufficient to present as <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> . 
establishment of a quantitative real-time pcr for <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 gene dosage assay indirect analysis was not able to elucidate the carrier status of two other females iv4 and iv8 in family <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-1 . 
the investigations included the history , clinical signs , <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibody <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> ) reactivity , haematological , serum biochemical and radiological findings , and the treatment and progress of the disease and were compared to results from 20 healthy tolling retrievers . 
indirect analysis a highly polymorphic dinucleotide repeat <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-ca located within intron 1 was used for carrier testing in both families . 
segregation analysis using the <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-ca marker in the family <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-2 showed that the sister ( iii2 ) of the affected individuals had inherited the maternal allele (a ) that has been transmitted to the affected males ( fig . 1 ) , thus indicative of the sister to be a probable carrier of the exon 6 deletion in the <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 gene . 
it commonly manifests as a unilateral or bilateral asymmetric <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> associated with moderate hyperemia and mucopurulent discharge . 
out of these ten patients , only one had obvious perianal <START:PHENOTYPE> sepsis <END> , while the rest had no prominent septic source [12 ] . 
the clinical application of sti571 in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> is therefore rather doubtful . 
symptoms ranged from none to focal cranial nerve deficit to <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> [1 0-13 ] . 
background although <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> has an incidence of only about 10 cases/100,000 persons , it is the fourth to fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the western world . 
clinical manifestations of the <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> involve the conjunctiva and the cornea . 
the method involves amplification of an exon included in the deletion ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-exon 8 ) and normalization of genomic template by analyzing a reference locus with known copy number . 
conclusion our data demonstrate that sti571 inhibits <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell growth with high gi50 concentrations through tyrosine-kinase receptor independent pathways . 
this patient had no precipitating factors for brain abscess , other than a <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> detected by bubble-contrast echocardiography. 
sti571 inhibited cell proliferation in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell lines with gi50 concentrations ranging from 17 to 31.5 microm . 
the association of the brain abscess with dental <START:PHENOTYPE> sepsis <END> was suggested by isolation of the same bacterial strain from the abscess , blood , and gingival pus . 
epidermal growth factor , igf-1 , and fibroblast growth factor-2 but not pdgf exerted growth stimulatory effects in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> cell lines . 
conclusion here we report the case of a patient with dental-gingival <START:PHENOTYPE> sepsis <END> that developed a brain abscess in the community . 
after two years of follow-up he has recovered almost completely , still showing residual <START:PHENOTYPE> lower limb weakness <END> . 
as a result of the above , adiponectin knockout mice develop more severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> than wild-type mice when fed with a diet aiming to induce non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [36 ] . 
infected thrombi in the systemic arterial circulation ( e.g . left-sided <START:PHENOTYPE> endocarditis <END> ) or having direct access to the systemic circulation ( eg <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary arteriovenous malformations <END> ) directly embolize the brain [6 ,10 ] . 
it reduces body fat , improves hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity , and is inversely associated with body mass index and <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> [32 ] . 
although uncommon , immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> myositis <END> in the dog has also been described [17 ,18 ] . 
group two included 59 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> and chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> ) with a wide qrs complex that required a permanent pacemaker because of a slow ventricular rate ( multisite stimulation in <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathies <END> atrial fibrillation ) . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 encodes a seven helix membrane g protein coupled receptor ( g protein coupled receptor ) localized to the membrane of intracellular organelles , namely the melanosomes in pigment cells . 
several missense mutations have also been described in <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 which result in defective intracellular transport and glycosylation due to misfolding of the protein . 
we detected an <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-exon 8/dmd-exon 4 ratio of 0.56 in female iii8 , thus confirming the presence of the heterozygous deletion of exon 8 in this obligate carrier , while the female and male controls showed a ratio of approximately 1. 0 ( 0.93 and 0.98 , respectively ) ( fig . 3 ) . 
a secondary diagnosis of bacterial pre septal <START:PHENOTYPE> cellulitis <END> was made and the treatment was changed to oral ciprofloxacin 750 mg twice daily for one week , plus two hourly topical exocin drops . 
besides <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> , other systemic antinuclear antibodies-positive <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune diseases <END> , referred to as systemic lupus erythematosus-related diseases , have been described in human patients , in many cases with overlapping diagnostic features . 
gene dosage analysis in the two females iv4 and iv8 whose carrier status was previously undefined clearly established that they were both carriers of an exon 8 deletion ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-exon8/dmd-exon 4 ratio of 0.47 and 0.42 , respectively ) . 
a novel frameshift <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 point mutation in the index patient ( iv1 ) of family <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-3 that did not show exon deletion , sequence analysis of all coding exons including the exon-intron boundaries revealed a deletion of a single nucleotide g at position 310 of the cdna introducing a subsequent premature stop codon one codon downstream , predicting a deleterious protein product . 
several efforts have been made to identify definite criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> in the dog , as has been attempted in the case of human <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> [4 ,5 ] , but no uniform list of such criteria for dogs has so far been presented . 
this newly described mutation ( 310delg ) in exon 2 of the <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 gene creates a taqi restriction site . 
sti571 has specific activity in inhibiting c-kit , pdgf and abl receptor tyrosine kinases and has proven successful in the treatment of cml and <START:PHENOTYPE> gist <END> patients . 
clinical signs that have been described are , e.g. , musculoskeletal disorders , skin disorders , <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polymyositis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> [6-13 ] . 
although the pedigree of family oai-3 initially suggested the patient iv1 to be a sporadic case , pcr-restriction analysis identified the patient 's maternal uncle ( iii3) , known to have only a <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased visual acuity <END> at age 38 , as hemizygous for the mutation . 
here , we investigated the potential role of sti571 in <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> . 
systemic <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune diseases <END> in dogs have previously mainly been referred to as <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> ) . 
on examination , there was marked <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> of the upper and lower lids accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> erythema <END> . 
one hallmark of <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> is high titres of circulating <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> ) , which can be demonstrated by the indirect immunofluorescence ( indirect immunofluorescence ) antinuclear antibodies test . 
different prevalences of intragenic <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 deletions have been reported , ranging from 8 % to 5 0 % in different studies . 
as approximately 5 0 % of the <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 mutations reported to date , the three mutations described in this study lead to a truncated <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 protein and , presumably , to a complete loss of function . 
mcf-7 cells-7 cells-7 <START:PHENOTYPE> breast carcinoma <END> cells were maintained as indicated previously , and utilized as a cell culture positive control . 
a diagnosis of viral <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> was made and viral plus bacterial swabs were taken . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> is an aggressive <START:PHENOTYPE> malignancy <END> characterized by low responsiveness to chemotherapy and radiotherapy . 
however , a fraction of brain abscesses are poorly explained by the above , occuring in patients with infectious sites lacking direct access to the systemic circulation ( eg right <START:PHENOTYPE> endocarditis <END> , septic <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombophlebitis <END> , odontogenic or intraabdominal abscess ) . 
a <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> may precipitate the development of brain abscess in these cases [11 ] . 
the foramen ovale serves as a physiologic right-to-left intracardiac <START:PHENOTYPE> shunt <END> during intrauterine life . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis causes a reduced density of functioning acetylcholiner at the postjunctional membrane [41 ] . 
ii ventak <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> /contak cd [22] enrolled 581 patients with heart failure , most of whom had an ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> , who also had an indication for an implantable cardioverter defibrillator . 
din the radiation fieldse name and synonyms nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome ( nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome ) gorlin syndrome gorlin-goltz syndrome <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell nevus <END> syndrome , <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell nevus <END> syndrome ( omim 109400 ) fifth phacomatosis definition the syndrome , delin the radiation fieldted by gorlin and goltz in 1960 [1] , was first reported in 1894 [2 ,3 ] and has been gin the radiation field several different names : diagnostic crin the radiation fieldia , based on the most frequent and/or specific features of the syndrome , were defin the radiation field by evans et al . in the journal of medical genetics in 1993 [5 ] , and modified by kimonis et al . in 1997 [6 ] . 
the majority of patients were male , had new york heart association class ii to iv <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> , and a qrs duration >12 0 ms . 
patients with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome should strictly avoid an excessin the radiation fieldsun exposure . 
cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( implantable cardioverter defibrillator ) therapy recently there has been some trials evaluating the combined use of cardiac resynchronization therapy and implantable cardioverter defibrillator in patients of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> . 
in familial cases with unidentified <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 mutations , indirect approach based on linkage analysis using microsatellites may be of help but requires extensive familial dna analysis and may be unconclusive in some individuals . 
i insync trial [44 ] demonstrated the efficacy and safety of implanting a combined device in 362 patients with class iii and iv <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> who also required an implantable cardioverter defibrillator . 
comment preseptal <START:PHENOTYPE> cellulitis <END> may occur in three clinical scenarios [2 ] ; 
also , the identification of <START:PHENOTYPE> macromelanosomes <END> on skin biopsy can be useful for supporting the diagnosis and identifying carriers eventhough it is not a specific and obligate criteria . 
our observation is in agreement with previous report by rosenberg and schwartz.who stated that <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 is underdiagnosed and pinpoints the fact that the clinical investigation of patients in specialized consultation may be required for accurate and differential diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 . 
as a direct result of localised trauma , as an infection or inflammation of adjacent structures or in patients with coexisting <START:PHENOTYPE> sinusitis <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 is thought to be involved in the regulation of biogenesis and maturation of melanosomes through activation of heterotrimeric g proteins on the cytoplasmic side of melanosomal membrane . 
results indication for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation was clinical evidence of non sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> ( non sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> ) in all 35 patients . 
the aberrant pigment production associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 could be caused by a defect in a yet unidentified intracellular signal transduction system that regulates the growth of melanosomesconclusions the three mutations reported here have been found in patients who were initially misdiagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nystagmus <END> when they where examined first . 
data have been obtained concerning comparative aspects of clinical manifestations , development of pathological signs and tissue distribution of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus variants . 
background macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( migration inhibitory factor ) is a proinflammatory cytokine that may play a role in several disease states , including <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> sepsis <END> , crohn 's disease , allograft rejection , <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> . 
this is similar to the severe decrements we observed in organophosphate-poisoned patients who had <START:PHENOTYPE> severe muscle weakness <END> . 
these data have practical importance when discussing the pathobiology of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> in the host species . 
rahbari and mehregan noted that 2% of patients under 45 years of age with <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> have the syndrome [13 ] . 
the observations are useful for the early diagnosis of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , with special regard to the detection and identification of the very mild or inapparent clinical manifestations . 
at one end of the spectrum the patients demonstrate only the electrophysiological abnormalities without clinically detectable <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> , and at the other end , patients progress to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular weakness <END> with deterioration of electrophysiological measurements and the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> . 
however , increased pulmonary arterial pressure due to <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> can provide a mechanism [8 ,9] . 
if this link were true , clinically silent <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> may pose serious risks to otherwise healthy , non-immunocompromised individuals , by precipitating embolic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> and brain abscess . 
this and other reports collectively suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> may be implicated in the pathogenesis of brain abscess , pending larger case-control studies that would be required for proof-of-concept . 
the cabg-patch trial had selected patients on the basis of signal-averaged ecg , a marker that may not be as sensitive for predicting <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction . 
after identification of a mutation in the <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 gene , clinical signs were re-evaluated . 
they found no evidence of improved survival among the group of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> , depressed left ventricular function and abnormal signal-average electrocardiogram in whom a defibrillator was implanted prophylactically at the time of elective cabg [8 ] . 
ophthalmological examination revealed signs consistent with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 in all affected males re-examined . 
the cabg <START:PHENOTYPE> patch <END> trial was a prospective randomized trial evaluating the prophylactic implantation of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in patients with ejection fraction ( ejection fraction ) < 36 % who underwent cabg . 
secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor levels were found to be decreased in nasal secretion after antigen challenge in vivo as well as in bronchial alveolar lavage obtained from <START:PHENOTYPE> asthmatics <END> compared to healthy subjects . 
clinical examination <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nystagmus <END> was diagnosed in individuals iv3 in pedigree <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-1 , i1 , iii1 and iii3 in pedigree <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-2 and iv1 in pedigree <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-3 following routine ophthalmological examination . 
the patients had normal hair and skin <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> . 
concerning classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus , s nchez-gord n et al . 
there was no <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> or nyctalopia . 
chlamydial <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> results from accidental transfer of genital discharge infected with chlamydia trachomatis , an obligate intracellular parasite , into the eye . 
the real-time fluorescent pcr gene dosage assay that we have developed in this study is an accurate , non radioactive and fast method for gene carrier assessment that can be applied to any type of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 gene deletion . 
conclusion the in vivo studies and the accompanied diagnostic approaches provided useful data on the comparative pathology of three virulence variants of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus . 
methods families affected males in pedigrees <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-1 , <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-2 , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-3 were initially diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nystagmus <END> inherited in an x-linked pattern , and blood samples from 47 individuals were referred to our laboratory for genotyping in the purpose to identify the genetic interval with which a putative gene could be located . 
lin the radiation fieldexpectancy in nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome is not significantly altered but morbidity from complications can be substantial . 
in this case , the symptoms were present in a sexually active young female with concurrent evidence of a papillary <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> productive of purulent discharge . 
while our a priori diagnostic criteria restricted a diagnosis of intermediate syndrome to patients with mrc <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of grade 3 or less , this did identify a subgroup with worse prognosis . 
abbreviations <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary arteriovenous malformation <END> , pulmonary arteriovenous malformation <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> , patent foramen ovale <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease computed tomography , computed tomography magnetic resonance imaging , magnetic resonance imaging intensive care unit , intensive care unit competing interests the author(s ) declare that they have no competing interests . 
these abnormal placentae are characterized by generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> interstitial fibrosis <END> and fibrinoid degeneration of villous stroma , and are associated with cellular apoptosis and congestion of villous sinusoids . 
typical repetitive nerve stimulation findings in the forme fruste group suggest that <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of greater than mrc grade 3 in neck flexors and proximal limb muscles with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of muscles supplied by the motor cranial nerves is clinically useful as it reveals a much higher incidence of intermediate syndrome than that is usually described . 
vitamin a analogs may play a preventin the radiation fieldrole against development of new <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> . 
it is clear that group i represented the case of rapidly developing , fatal classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> . 
it is difficult to determine the pathogen responsible for any <START:PHENOTYPE> cellulitis <END> without aspirating a culture sample and so treatment is usually instituted by an assumption of the most common causative organisms . 
one of these dogs showed <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> and one dog displayed swelling of the nose ( the skin biopsy result indicating " plasmacytic and pyogranulomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> with occasional panniculitis " ) . 
however , none of the dogs showed any <START:PHENOTYPE> joint swelling <END> , even though specific joints were painful when manipulated . 
moreover , a total of 9 dogs also showed pain when muscles were palpated , with 6 of them having the <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle pain <END> diffusely distributed and 3 of them displaying more pronounced local <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle pain <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> have occasionally been noted unassociated with brain tumors and possibly due to focal neuronal <START:PHENOTYPE> heterotopia <END> [58 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> occurs in about 5 % of cases . 
post-anaesthetic weight changes the mean <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> in our colic horses is similar to that in earlier studies [15 ,36 ] . 
skeletal system skeletal manin the radiation fieldtations are also present in nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome [46 ] . 
approximately 20 to 30 percent of patients with symptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> have an interventricular conduction delay [2 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> is also seen in otherwise normal subjects with isolated left bundle branch block [10 ] . 
main clinical manin the radiation fieldtations include multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> odontogenic keratocysts of the jaws <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis of palms and soles <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal abnormalities <END> , intracranial <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopic calcifications <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> facial dysmorphism <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip/palate <END> and severe eye anomalies ) . 
a pathogenetic link of elevated adipose and serum levels of retinol-binding protein 4 with <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and diabetes has been found in both animal and human studies [63 65 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> and interventricular conduction delay the most common causes for an interventricular conduction delay in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> are delayed left ventricular activation and left bundle branch block ( left bundle branch block ) . 
intellectual deficit is present in up to 5 % of cases . <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> ( varying clinically from flesh-colored papules to ulcerating plaques and in diameter from 1 to 10 mm ) are most commonly located on the face , back and chest . 
resynchronization therapies can be present in a single device , in a device equipped with <START:PHENOTYPE> bradycardia <END> pacing support , or incorporated into an implantable cardioverter defibrillator [9 ] . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> and the increased lipid metabolism in the postoperative period indicate an ongoing breakdown of body reserves that would be desirable to reduce . 
other skeletal signs are <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> (40% ) , and abnormalities such as bifid , win the radiation field fused , partially missing or underdeveloped ribs (30 60% ) [11 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal abnormalities <END> ( affecting the shape of the ribs , vertebral column bones , and the skull ) are frequent . 
as a result of the abnormal growth of the skull ( > 60 cm in adults) , about 70 % of patients affected by nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome have eyes which appear win the radiation field apart than usual . 
nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome is caused by mutations in the ptch1 gene and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with complete penetrance and variable expressivity . 
about 5 10 % of nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome patients develop the brain <START:PHENOTYPE> malignancy <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> , which may be a potential cause of early death . 
case presentation a 53-yr-old farmer presented 8 days after having suffered a <START:PHENOTYPE> seizure <END> . 
a recent study done by erdogan et al [12 ] estimated that biventricular pacing might be considered as an adjunct to standard <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> therapy in 5-1 0 patients per year per 100,000 residents in industrial countries . 
hence a <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> may be sufficient for the development of brain abscess in clinical circumstances when bacteremia of the venous circulation occurs [10 ] . 
the degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> correlated well with the electrophysiological features during progression of intermediate syndrome . 
the criteria for inclusion were severe <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> ( new york heart association class iii or iv) , <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , qrs duration > 120 ms , or the presence of left bundle branch block or rbundle branch block . 
discussion we found characteristic abnormalities on repetitive nerve stimulation associated with the development and resolution of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> in intermediate syndrome . 
using these criteria , approximately 10 percent of an unselected group of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> patients who are admitted to a typical district general hospital in united kingdom during a calendar year would be candidates for biventricular pacing . 
this occurred only in the group who fulfilled our a priori diagnostic criteria , suggesting that these criteria are clinically useful in identifying patients at risk of late <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> . 
none of the dogs showed any signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> anorexia <END> . 
leptin levels were initially found to be significantly higher in 47 non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients than 47 controls and correlated with the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic steatosis <END> but not of necroinflammation or fibrosis [69 ] . 
clinical findings each tolling retriever patient suffered from a persistent lameness , with the <START:PHENOTYPE> joint pain <END> waxing and waning , affecting different legs and joints . 
the high incidence of post-anaesthetic complications in the healthy group of horses ( four horses with gait dysfunction , two of which showed clinical symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> ) may be explained by the prolonged duration of anaesthesia of nearly four hours . 
cytokines and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis human studies the above observations in experimental models of <START:PHENOTYPE> steatosis <END> and liver injury , elucidating a potential association of various cytokines in the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis , have resulted in their evaluation in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis . 
in line with some human studies [69 ] , however , no clear association , was found between the degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> gait disturbances <END> and the concentration of creatine kinase post anaesthesia in either group of horses . 
bifid wedges , fused vertebra and <START:PHENOTYPE> sprengel anomaly <END> ( elevation of the scapula with rotation toward the spin the radiation fieldwith <START:PHENOTYPE> scoliosis <END> ) are observed in 10 to 40% of patients . 
it is estimated that approximately 8 to 15 percent of patients with advanced <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> have pacemakers implanted for symptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> bradycardia <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida occulta <END> of the cervical or thoracic vertebrae is found in 60 % of cases [60 ] . 
however , in a series studied by kimonis et al. , the <START:PHENOTYPE> spina bifida occulta <END> occurred in only 20% of patients [6 ] . 
this approval was granted on the basis of several studies of acute resynchronization therapy and data compiled in approximately 150 patients receiving biventricular or left ventricular stimulation for three months as part of two controlled studies ( insync [13 ,14 ] and path-congestive <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> [15] ) .

in europe resynchronization therapy is approved for symptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> that occurs in the setting of interventricular conduction delay or bundle branch block . 
in a recent study , we showed that leptin levels are significantly higher in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis patients than patients with chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> viral hepatitis <END> and correlate with more severe fibrosis in univariate analysis [73 ] . 
in the united states , resynchronization therapy with or without an implantable cardioverter defibrillator is approved for patients with new york heart association class iii-iv <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> on the basis of the chronic studies described below , which were all performed with a control group randomly assigned to no resynchronization therapy [16-22] . 
the reindeer lost live body weight when feed was restricted but most of the <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> could be accounted for by loss of rumen content . 
histologically , the flame-lin the radiation fieldlesions consist of fibrous connectin the radiation fieldtissue , nerves , and blood vessels , in the radiation field , they are <START:PHENOTYPE> hamartomas <END> [4 ] . 
usually , these do not cause problems , even if calvarial involvement may gin the radiation fieldthe erroneous impression that <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> has spread to bone [62 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> bone cysts <END> can also occur in the long bones of the arms and legs , the pelvis and the calvaria [61 ] ; 
initial data in patients with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> , prior atrio-ventricular ( atrio-ventricular ) junction ablation for rate control of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> , and chronic right ventricular pacing has shown that there are significant benefits by upgrading from right ventricular to biventricular pacing [24] . 
nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome ( nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome ) , also known as gorlin syndrome , is a hereditary condition characterin the radiation field by a win the radiation fieldrange of developmental abnormalities and a predisposition to neoplasms . 
effect on contractile function hemodynamic data acquired in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> and bundle branch block ( bundle branch block ) during acute or chronic biventricular or left ventricular stimulation have consistently shown improvements in measures of contractile response , such as force of contraction , cardiac output , left ventricular ejection fraction ( left ventricularef) , and pulmonary artery pressure , when compared to normal sinus rhythm or right ventricular pacing [25,32 ] . 
using a mouse model of endotoxin induced acute liver injury in kk-ay obese mice , masaki et al . found that adiponectin prevents hepatic injury by inhibiting the synthesis and/or release of tumour necrosis factor-a [37] , while xu et al . also observed a protective effect of adiponectin in <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease in mice [38 ] . 
finally , adiponectin induction was associated with the protective action of saturated fat against the development of alcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease in mice [34 ] . 
tumour necrosis factor-a tumour necrosis factor-a has also a central role in the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> and subsequently non-alcoholic steatohepatitis . 
an increased mechanical efficiency without increase in oxygen demand can be effective in drug refractory angina in <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> . 
trans -esophageal bubble-contrast echocardiography revealed shunting of air bubbles injected via a subclavian vein catheter directly from the right atrium to the left atrium and ventricle within 1 heart-beat after injection , confirming the existence of a <START:PHENOTYPE> patent foramen ovale <END> ( figure 2 ) . 
elevated circulating tumour necrosis factor-a levels are associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> both in animal models and humans [40 , 41 ] . 
cardiac resynchronization therapy has been shown to decrease the functional <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral regurgitation <END> in advanced systolic <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> [33 ,34 ] . 
furthermore , the 238 tumour necrosis factor-a gene polymorphism was found significantly more frequently in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> than healthy controls [42 ] and the 1031c and 863a polymorphisms in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis than <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> [43 ] . 
in another series of 18 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ) and an interventricular conduction delay , aortic and left ventricular pressures , dp/dt , and pressure-volume measurements were obtained during stimulation at single right ventricular endocardial sites , at single left ventricular epicardial sites , or during biventricular pacing [36 ] . 
this study suggested that cardiac resynchronization therapy increases the ischemic threshold in <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> patients on the long term , by markedly reducing the incidence of drug refractory anginal episodes , and by increasing a previously profoundly reduced exercise capacity . 
the post-anaesthetic period was associated with increased lipolysis and <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> in the colic horses , indicating a negative energy balance at least during the first week post-operatively . 
a study done by gasparini et al [35 ] showed the beneficial effects of cardiac resynchronization therapy , during a mean follow-up of 9 months , in increasing the angina threshold in severely symptomatic patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> ) not amenable to cardiac revascularization .

presentations include swelling and/or displaced , <START:PHENOTYPE> impacted teeth <END> . 
those patients who did not develop <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> but showed severe decrement or a combination of decrement-increment and repetitive fade recovered earlier than those who developed <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> . 
pericardial flaps , however , are associated with the development of post-operative <START:PHENOTYPE> pericarditis <END> , and in cases of large pedicled flaps , they may be associated with pericardial tamponade if the reconstruction is made too tight . 
we report on three additional white <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 unrelated families , with a total of fourty seven individuals , which were initially referred to our laboratory for <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nystagmus <END> . 
in spite of a well-defined clinical presentation , a few individuals initially misdiagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nystagmus <END> have been shown to be affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 by screening the <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1gene . 
the size , shape and number of melanocytes are normal in the skin , hair follicle and retinal pigment epithelium in <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 patients , but they contain ( although not specifically ) variable proportions of giant melanosomes . 
the disease typically results in severely impaired visual acuity in affected males who also manifest variable <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> photophobia <END> , and misrouting of optic pathway . 
there have been a few reports of ameloblastoma arising in odontogenic keratocysts [32 ] or , rarely , of <START:PHENOTYPE> squamous cell carcinoma <END> [33 ] . 
the most frequent findings in hemizygous individuals with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 are <START:PHENOTYPE> foveal hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> of the retina and iris translucency together with normally pigmented skin and hair . 
prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 is estimated around 1 in 50 ,000 live births in caucasian populations . 
these <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic disorders <END> must be distinguished from the <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital motor nystagmus <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital motor nystagmus <END> ) , a hereditary disorder characterized by bilateral ocular oscillations which occurs in the absence of any apparent ocular disease . 
background <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nystagmus <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital nystagmus <END> ) is the common symptom of a range of diseases involving the macula from infancy on , and includs at least three x-linked disorders : nettleship-falls <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 ; mim#300500 ) mapped to xp22.3 , <START:PHENOTYPE> complete congenital stationary night blindness <END> ( csnb1 ; mim#310500) , mapped to xp11 .3 and blue-cone monochromatism ( cbbm ; mim#303700) , mapped to xq28 .

the inflammation under the upper eyelid may be sufficient to present as <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , however previously it has not been documented to cause a preseptal <START:PHENOTYPE> cellulitis <END> . 
our method of real-time quantitative pcr of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 exons with dmd exon as external standard performed on the lightcycler allows quick and accurate carrier-status assessment for at-risk females . 
of these 30 patients five developed <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of the neck flexors , proximal limb muscles , and cranial nerves but did not meet predefined criteria for a clinical diagnosis of intermediate syndrome as they had only mild ( mrc grade 4 ) <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> . 
a 15 -year-old girl was diagnosed with a left viral <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> . 
mice genetically deficient in tnuclear factor receptor i have proved resistant to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis induced by two different diets [45 , 46 ] , while treatment of leptin-deficient mice with tumour necrosis factor-a antibodies improved hepatic <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> [47 ] . 
five days later , she returned with marked <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> of the left upper and lower lids accompanied by <START:PHENOTYPE> erythema <END> . 
a number of rodent studies suggest that the major target of resistin action is the liver , causing hepatic <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , with additional effects on skeletal muscles and adipose tissue [49 52 ] . 
the markers of sympathetic activation , such as serum norepinephrine and heart rate variability , often vary directly with the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> , these markers have not predictably changed in patients in whom resynchronization therapy appears to improve contractile function [37-40 ] . 
the patient showed no abnormal physical signs except from purulent gingival drainage and several septic teeth , and was alert and oriented with a glascow <START:PHENOTYPE> coma <END> scale score of 15 /15 . 
reverse remodeling was also observed in the contak cd , path- <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> , and vigor congestive heart failure trials , in which biventricular produced a significant reduction in left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions on echocardiography [38 ,43 ] . 
reverse remodeling based upon echocardiography , preliminary data from the miracle trial [16 ] suggested that biventricular pacing is associated with reverse remodeling in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> . biventricular pacing produced an improvement in cardiac structure and function with a significant reduction in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral regurgitation <END> jet area and left ventricular mass , both signs of reverse remodeling [42 ] . 
clinical trials there are a number of trials evaluating the role of resynchronization therapy in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> due to systolic dysfunction . 
in skeletal muscle , it seems to reduce the uptake and metabolism of free fatty acids , thus contributing to <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> [53 ] . 
in the path-congestive <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> trial , baseline left ventricular end-diastolic volumes were significantly smaller in those who exhibited reverse remodeling with biventricular pacing compared to those who did not have a reduction in left ventricular volume [43 ] .

his dental health was impaired with dental , periodontal , and gingival <START:PHENOTYPE> sepsis <END> and a recent history of dental procedures , for which he did not take antibiotics . 
they were randomly assigned to a cardiac-resynchronization group ( 228 patients ) or to a control group ( 225 patients ) for six months , while conventional therapy for <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> was maintained . 
there were three of 78 patients who did not develop clinically detectable <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> but developed decrement-increment at high frequency stimulations . 
spotted <START:PHENOTYPE> meningeal calcifications <END> are rare . 
electrocardiography showed normal rhythm , a rate of 85/min , the known <START:PHENOTYPE> heart block <END> , and no changes from a previous test . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> ectopic calcification <END> of the central nervous system and other brain signs <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopic calcifications <END> of the central nervous system have been reported : lamellar calcification of the falx cerebri (7 0 85% ) [11 ] , calcification of the tentorium cerebelli (2 0 40% ) [11 ] , the petroclinoid ligament (20% ) and the diaphragma sellae (6 0 80% ) [38 ] , and complete or partial bony bridging of the sella turcica ( 25% ) [11 ] . 
a secondary diagnosis of bacterial pre septal <START:PHENOTYPE> cellulitis <END> was made and the treatment was changed a broad spectrum oral antibiotic . 
in pedigree <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-2 , exon 6 was co-amplified with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 exon 9 ( fig . 2b ) . 
other signs reported are cysts of the choroid plexus of the third and lateral ventricles of the brain , intraparenchymal brain cysts , <START:PHENOTYPE> arachnoid cysts <END> , glial nodules projecting from the lateral ventricles , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> with or without <START:PHENOTYPE> lipoma <END> [39] , "empty " sella syndrome [39] , <START:PHENOTYPE> communicating hydrocephalus <END> [40-43] , <START:PHENOTYPE> meningioma <END> [44 ,45 ] , cysts of the septum pellucidum [46 ] and <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> [44 ,47-55 ] ( see the paragraph " other tumors " ) . 
, was detected in the proband iii1 of family <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-2 . 
two novel <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 gene deletions the <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 gene was then examined for mutations , and we detected one deletion encompassing exons 7 8 ( pedigree <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-1 ) , and one deletion encompassing exon 6 ( pedigree <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-2 ) . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 gene was then extensively screened , and the disease-causing mutation could be identified in the three families reported in this study . 
in pedigree <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-1 , exons 7 and 8 were co-amplified with <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 exons 9 and 6 , respectively ( fig . 2a) . 
the amplification failure was shown to be specific for this portion of the <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 gene by using duplex-pcr . 
chlamydia ( or adult inclusion ) <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> is the most common cause of chronic follicular <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> resulting from infection by chlamydia trachomatis . 
1 for a microsatellite in <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 intron 1 . 
results and discussion analysis of x-linked markers in the two pedigrees ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-1 and <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-2 ) initially reported as familial cases diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> x-linked congenital nystagmus <END> was consistent with an association between the affected phenotype and the ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> type 1 locus , as exemplified in fig . 
electrophysiologic testing programmed electrical stimulation ( programmed electrical stimulation ) has been evaluated in non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> . 
case presentation a 72 year old lady , with known <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> ) , was seen in the outpatient department with a six month history of progressive shortness of breath . 
here we present the first population-based association analysis of calpain 5 gene gene in traits related to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and other components of metabolic syndrome . 
sustained ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> ( monomorphic and polymorphic vt , or vf ) may be induced in up to 38 % of patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> undergoing programmed electrical stimulation , but this may have limited clinical significance [37 ] . 
our finding that esr1 mrna levels in adipose tissue are inversely correlated with rate of basal lipolysis might suggest that low adipose tissue esr1 levels , as observed in <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> [16 ] , increases basal lipolysis . 
we present a case of a 72 year old lady with repeated exacerbations of <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> which did not respond to conventional treatment . 
as the <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular weakness <END> progressed , the change occurred at intermediate frequencies and there was a corresponding decrement in the amplitude of the tenth compound muscle action potential , which was most marked with high frequency stimulations . 
human <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> is associated with increased rate of basal lipolysis in all fat depots and lipolytic resistance to catecholamines in subcutaneous fat [39 ] . 
milner et al . performed programmed stimulation in 19 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias ; 
single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in our present project , that previously have been associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> related and <START:PHENOTYPE> eating disorders <END> , were not associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in the present project . 
the reproducibility of programmed stimulation is greater in patient s who presented with clinical vt as opposed to those with <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> . 
finally , we genotyped rs928554 and rs4986938 , but not rs1256 049 , implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> eating disorders <END> [ 19 ,20] . 
this pattern was typically seen at 30 hz stimulations when patients showed maximal <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> ( n = 7 ) . 
she also reported several episodes of streaky haemoptysis but there was no history of <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> . 
methods patients this population based study included 606 non-related caucasian men ( n = 278 , 46% ) and women ( n = 328 , 54% ) recruited by a simple random sampling approach from a cross-sectional population-based epidemiological survey in the province of segovia in central spain ( castille ) aimed at investigating the prevalence of anthropometric and physiological parameters related to <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and other components of the metabolic syndrome [20] . 
10 had survived an out-of-hospital <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrest <END> , 8 had monomorphic vt ( monomorphic vt) , and 1 had non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> [38 ] . 
introduction <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> of unknown origin ( <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> of unknown origin ) is not an uncommon problem in clinical canine medicine . 
among patients who died within 5 years of being diagnosed with <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> , survivin mrna levels were also high in both initial biopsy samples . 
phenotype measurements we have analysed the existence of association between calpain 5 gene and twelve clinical parameters : body mass index ( body mass index) , waist circumference ( waist circumference) , systolic and diastolic blood pressures ( systolic and diastolic blood pressures , diastolic blood pressure ) , fasting glucose , 2-hours glucose , fasting insulin , <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> ( ir-homeostasis model assessment method) , total cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides ( triglycerides ) . 
in humans the relative frequencies of causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> of unknown origin are well established [14 ,18 ] , with the cases being devided as follows : infection 40% , <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> 20% , immune-mediated 15 % , miscellaneous 20% and 5 % remaining undiagnosed . 
the male subset in our sample was too small to exclude that esrs have an impact on <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in men . 
the definition of <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> of unknown origin in dogs was expanded by [8 ] to include dogs with temperature in excess of 40 c on more than one occasion . 
conclusion common esr1 gene alleles are unlikely to contribute to <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> in women , whereas a minor importance of esr2 on severe <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> cannot be excluded . 
these criteria are not directly applicable to canine medicine , but may serve as useful guidelines to exclude <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> of shorter duration associated with infections . 
discussion <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents . 
in human medicine the criteria which define <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> of unknown origin are (1 ) prolonged <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> of more than 3 weeks duration associated with non-specific signs of illness such as <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anorexia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> , (2 ) temperature at least 0.83 c above normal on several occasions and (3 ) diagnosis still uncertain after one week of hospitalization and routine laboratory tests [18 ,23,24] . 
tnf- was not detected in any serum of 15 dogs with immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , while 10 out of 13 presented with elevated interleukin-6 . 
contents of <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> ) , rheumatoid factor ( rheumatoid factor) , tumor necrosis factor ( tnf- ) and interleukin-6 ( interleukin-6 ) were measured in serum from 20 dogs with immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> . 
seven out of 20 patients were <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positive , 1 out of 20 was positive to antibodies against extractable nuclear antigens ( extractable nuclear antigens ) , 1 out of 20 was positive to antibodies against deoxynucleoproteins (deoxynucleoproteins ) , 2 out of 13 were <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid factor positive <END> and none out of 20 patients had antibodies against native dna in the serum . 
this indicate a role for interleukin-6 in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> in most cases . 
two years previously she had suffered a <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> resulting in mildly impaired left ventricular function ; 
the finding of non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> on holter monitoring was associated with a trend towards an increased risk of major arrhythmic events ( rr 1.7 , 95 % ci 0.9 to 3.3 , p= 0.11 ) . 
results main findings were : low carcass weight , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> , hemosiderosis in liver and spleen , subcutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> ( 18% ) and effusions to body cavities ( 18% ) . 
the prognostic value of non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> or frequent ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> remains unclear . 
other investigations of the carcasses included histology , bacteriology , parasitology ( counting of macro parasites and faecal egg counting) , analysis of vitamin e and selenium in liver , chemical and botanical analysis of rumen content , analysis of lipid content in femur bone marrow and estimation of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> by use of a muscle index . 
however , in a few intermediate syndrome patients who developed <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> we observed a particular pattern of repetitive nerve stimulation abnormalities during recovery rather than a simple reversal of effects . 
of those , 99 patients had documented asymptomatic non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> , while 157 controls with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> were free of documented ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> ) is a common cause of morbidity in the uk and is increasingly seen in elderly patients , often requiring multiple courses of steroids . 
figure 3 demonstrates how these changes look when plotted longitudinally in a patient who developed <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> following intermediate syndrome . 
the deaths were evenly divided between those that died of pump failure and those that died due to sudden death . non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> was a risk factor for death due to pump failure , but was not for sudden death . 
we present a case of a 72 year old lady with repeated exacerbations of <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> which did not respond to conventional treatment . 
grimm et al . recently assessed a cohort of 343 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> using multiple diagnostic tests to assess risk for sudden death [36 ] . 
during the 22 14 months of follow-up , both overall mortality and mortality due to sudden death were higher in patients with non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> than those without <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> ( 34.2 vs . 9.8% , p= 0.0001 and 15 .8 vs . 3.7% , p= 0.0037 ) . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> was estimated by the homeostasis model assessment ( homeostasis model assessment method-ir ) method according to the formula : insulin ( method according to the formula : insulin ) glucose ( mmol/l )/22.5 [22] . 
the crude prevalences of type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , impaired fasting glucose ( impaired fasting glucose ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired glucose tolerance <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired glucose tolerance <END> ) were respectively 8.7% , 13.6 % and 15 . 0% . 
lungs histologically , a mild hyperaemia , alveolar <START:PHENOTYPE> emphysema <END> and anthracosis was seen in the animals of all groups . 
progressive decrement pattern the patients who developed <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> severe muscle weakness <END> developed progressive decrement following a severe decrement ( figures 1e and 2d ) . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> was not observed in any case . 
severe decrement pattern at high frequency stimulations preceded <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> in four patients . 
defining peri-operative <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> following cardiac surgery has proven problematic due to the difficulty in interpreting pain , electrocardiographic ( electrocardiographic) , and haemodynamic changes in the early post operative phase . 
background <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial necrosis <END> causing release of cardiac enzymes ( cardiac enzyme ) following otherwise uncomplicated percutaneous coronary intervention has been associated with increased medium term mortality [1 ,2 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial necrosis <END> occurs frequently in patients undergoing cardiac surgery . 
this is the first published case of hsv tracheitis in a non immunosuppressed individual with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic lung disease <END> . 
background herpes simplex virus ( hsv1 ) infection may be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic lung disease <END> not responding to conventional treatment . 
olshausen et al . followed a group of 73 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> for a minimum of 3 years [34 ] . 
the definition of peri-operative <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> following coronary artery bypass surgery should include elevation of ck-mb three or more times the upper limit of normal . 
the metabolic syndrome status was established according to atpiii definition as it was recently modified : presence of at least three components between abdominal <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> ( waist circumference 102 cm men , 88 cm women ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> ( triglycerides 150 mg/dl) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> ( 85 /130 mmhg) , high-density lipoprotein-c ( < 40 mg/dl men , < 50 mg/dl women ) and fasting glucose 100 mg/dl [23] . 
signal averaged ecg several groups have evaluated the performance of the signal averaged ecg (signal-averaged ecg ) to stratify risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> as a result of a variety of cardiac diseases is an ever growing , challenging condition that demands profound insight in the electrical and mechanical state of the myocardium . 
normal peripheral blood cell counts but a decreased number of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells in individuals with 5p syndrome the majority of individuals with dyskeratosis congenita develop signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> ( marrone et al. , 2005 ; mason et al. , 2005 ) , which is thought to be due to a deficiency of telomerase in hematopoietic stem cells and their immediate progeny . 
raised blood pressure ( systolic and diastolic blood pressures 130 or diastolic blood pressure 85 ) or treatment of previously diagnosed <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , raised fasting plasma glucose ( fpg 100 mg/dl ) or previously diagnosed type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> . 
the use of programmed electrical stimulation for risk stratification in the non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> population has not provided satisfying results . 
with the exception of four individuals who had slightly <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased hemoglobin <END> levels ( 11 13 g dl 1 respectively) , peripheral blood values were normal for hemoglobin ( 13.07 1.28 g dl 1 ) , white blood cell counts ( 8 .33 2.7 103 per l) , platelet count ( 277 .44 72 .82 103 per l) , mean corpuscle volume ( 87.23 5.05 fl) , and polymorphonuclear cells count ( 4.07 1.59 103 per l ) . 
this suggests that the positive predictive value of induced polymorphic ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> is low in the non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> population . 
further investigations , including immunoglobulins , complement , specific antibody levels and a <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> screen were all normal . 
aside from the rare occasion of inducible monomorphic vt , programmed electrical stimulation may frequently result in the induction of non-specific <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> . 
in recent years electrical properties have gained attention as <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> could be improved by biventricular resynchronization therapy . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> was measured to lie between 39 .9 and 41 .4 c . 
subsequent to her treatment with intravenous acyclovir , she underwent two further admissions with episodes of dyspnoea and mild <START:PHENOTYPE> stridor <END> . 
meinertz et al . evaluated 42 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and performed programmed electrical stimulation in all patients [41 ] . 
these snps were selected because they had been associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome , an <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> related phenotype , in a previous work by our group [18 ] . 
86 % of the study group had polymorphic ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> , with three or more beats of pmvt induced in 26% of the study group . 
none of the patients who suffered sudden death had an induced <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> during programmed electrical stimulation . 
she was reviewed by the immunologist who found no <START:PHENOTYPE> immune deficiency <END> . 
in addition , we have been offering delivery of these apparently uncomplicated monochorionic twins at approximately 34 to 35 weeks ' gestation following antenatal corticosteroid administration and thorough counseling regarding the risks of expectant management versus elective <START:PHENOTYPE> preterm delivery <END> . 
the most common finding with programmed electrical stimulation in patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> is inducible polymorphic vt or vf [37 , 39 ,41 ] . 
furthermore the specificity of induced <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> has been called into question . 
while ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> were induced in 42 % of patients , monomorphic vt was seen in only 8 % of the group . 
statistical analysis to analyze differences in genotype distribution , chi-squared association studies for metabolic syndrome , type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , impaired fasting glucose and <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired glucose tolerance <END> and test for deviation from hardy-weinberg equilibrium , we have used tests adapted from sasieni [25] at the online resource available at the institute for human genetics , munich , germany [26] or spss software ( ver . 11. 0.0. , lead technologies , inc ) . 
similarly , das et al . performed programmed electrical stimulation in 24 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and a mean ejection fraction of 25 12 % . 
the mean ef in this group was 17% , and they all had non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> on cardiac monitoring . programmed electrical stimulation in this group failed to produce a sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular arrhythmia <END> in any patients . 
stamato et al . performed programmed electrical stimulation in 15 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> [40 ] . 
nevertheless , the diagnostic yield of programmed electrical stimulation in the non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> population has been poor . 
one group showed only <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , while the others who showed <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle pain <END> and muscle and joint-pain , respectively . 
the criteria for being included into the material was <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> above 39 .9 c that did not respond to 2 successive treatments with different antibiotics , but to a subsequent prednisolone cure . 
in the present study we have investigated the occurrence of selected auto antibodies and 2 inflammatory mediators , interleukin-6 ( interleukin-6 ) and tumour necrosis factor ( tnf- ) in serum from dogs with <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> that we eventually diagnosed as immune-mediated . 
in canine medicine the relative frequency of different causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> of unknown origin varies between studies . 
the distribution suggested by [10 ] was infections 40% , <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> 20% , immune-mediated disease 20% , miscellaneous conditions 10 % and undiagnosed ( true <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> of unknown origin ) 10% . 
[4 ] claimed that infection is accounting for 5 0% , immunemediated disease 40% and <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> 10 % of cases with diagnosed causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> of unknown origin . 
[8 ] sorted 101 dogs with <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> of unknown origin into 6 main groups with the following result : infections 16 % , <START:PHENOTYPE> neoplasia <END> 9.5% , immune-mediated disease 22% , miscellaneous conditions 11 .5% , primary bone marrow abnormalities 22% , and true <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> of unknown origin 19 % . 
high resolution computerised tomography of her thorax showed a narrowing in the left main bronchus , with no <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphadenopathy <END> . 
13 ( 68% ) of these patients had their clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> reproduced in the ep lab . 
subsequently , due to an acute deterioration in symptoms , she was admitted with an infective exacerbation of <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease <END> . 
despite treatment , her symptoms continued to deteriorate and she developed an <START:PHENOTYPE> inspiratory stridor <END> . 
the available knowledge on the epidemiology of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> is limited , and more studies within this area are in demand according to the international task force on canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> [3 ] . 
the concern was raised that many attending veterinarians did not exclude cutaneous adverse food reactions before making the diagnosis of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> . 
introduction canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> ( canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> ) is a genetically-predisposed inflammatory and pruritic allergic skin disease , most commonly associated with ige antibodies to environmental allergens [1 ] . 
at slit-lamp examination there was no <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormality of the iris <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> and the lenses were transparent . 
more recently , telomerase reverse transcriptase gene mutations have been identified in rare individuals with autosomal dominant dyskeratosis congenita and in sporadic cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> ( armanios et al. , 2005 ; vulliamy et al. , 2005 ; yamaguchi et al. , 2005 ; liang et al. , 2006 ; vulliamy & dokal , 2006 ; xin et al. , 2007 ) . 
in family <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-1 the affected male iv3 , aged 10 at the time of presentation , had a visual acuity of 30/200 in re ( +2.5 0 sph/+1.5 0 cyl a 70 ) and 40/200 in le ( +2.5 0 sph/+1.00 a 180 ) . 
qt dispersion qt dispersion ( qt dispersion ) has been studied in the risk stratification of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> in patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> . 
there was a <START:PHENOTYPE> foveal hypoplasia <END> that was confirmed by the absence of the normal afluorescence of the macula . 
the fundus revealed a patchy aspect of the <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> in peripheral retina with some areas of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> . 
in family <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-2 , the 9-year old proband iii4 had a visual acuity of 40/200 in both eyes . 
it could be supposed that the absence of diagnosis on the first child did not allow a correlation of <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of corpus callosum <END> with the recurrence of a syndrome . 
the therapeutic options to treat advanced <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> today include resynchronization therapy . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> can begin in the first months of life and require suitable therapies ; 
mancini et al . evaluated 114 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> with signal-averaged ecg [44 ] . 
serious <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> also persists in operated patients . 
one patient still has <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> at the age of 9 years , while the other , at the age of six , had never suffered them . 
during follow-up , of the 20 patients with an abnormal signal-averaged ecg , 5 (20% ) suffered a sudden death , and three others either died from progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> or required urgent cardiac transplantation . 
however , in two of our patients the <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were fairly quickly resolved . 
in the case of obstructive <START:PHENOTYPE> azoospermia <END> histologically showing the sloughing off of germ cells , the expression patterns of connexin43 were similar to that of normal testes ( fig . 3 ) . 
fundus examination showed a slight depigmentation with moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> foveal hypoplasia <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> requires early surgery at the first days or months of life . 
however , fundus examination revealed a patchy <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> at the posterior pole and numerous , low contrasted gray dots in the mid periphery of the retinas . 
three to six generations of inbreeding were necessary to produce telomeres sufficiently <START:PHENOTYPE> short to <END> cause a short telomere phenotype ( blasco et al. , 1997 ; herrera et al. , 1999 ; liu et al. , 2000 ; niida et al. , 2000 ) . 
the apparently sporadic case iv2 in family <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-3 had , at 26 years of age , a visual acuity of 30/200 in both eyes with re ( +3.00 sph/3.5 0 cyl a 180 ) and le ( +4.25 sph/2.75 cyl a 180 ) . 
an abnormal result on signal-averaged ecg may be a marker of increased risk of sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> or death [43 ,44 ] . 
macroscopic findings the animals in group 2 showed a crusty <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> affecting the head but the hair colour and structure were normal . 
when the sections from normal control testes of patients undergoing orchidectomy for <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> were reacted with anti-connexin43 , a very strong brown staining was found in the part of plasma membrane of sertoli cells which was adjacent to the apical part of spermatogonia and to the basal part of primary spermatocytes , in the seminiferous tubules ( fig . 2c) . 
western blot analysis revealed a ~65 kda estrogen receptor alpha band in mcf-7 cells-7 cells-7 <START:PHENOTYPE> breast carcinoma <END> cells ( positive control ) . 
however , it must be kept in mind that the manifestations of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> are highly variable between individuals and a patient that fails to fulfil these criteria may still actually be atopic . 
due to these uncertainties regarding the diagnosing of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> , it is paramount that individuals included in studies regarding epidemiology , aetiology , therapy or diagnosis of the disease are properly characterized in order to ensure that the diagnosis is correct and to enable comparisons between studies . 
there was <START:PHENOTYPE> foveal hypoplasia <END> with some retinal vessels that crossed the macular area , confirmed by the absence of the normal afluorescence of the macula . 
at present , no definite diagnostic test exists for canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> and the diagnosis is based upon a typical clinical presentation after the exclusion of plausible differential diagnoses [4 ] . 
fundus examination showed a radial pattern of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> that spared the macula . 
the studies of signal-averaged ecg in the non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> population are complicated by the inclusion of individuals with bundle branch blocks ( bundle branch blocks ) , which compromises the utility of the signal-averaged ecg as an adequate method for risk stratification in this population . 
the main clinical sign of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> is <START:PHENOTYPE> pruritus <END> , particularly of the face , ears , paws , extremities and/or ventrum [5 ] . 
hence , before a diagnosis is made it is important to rule out other pruritic diseases like flea allergy <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> , sarcoptic mange and other ectoparasites , bacterial <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> , malassezia dermatitis and cutaneous adverse food reactions ( adverse food reactions ) . 
a set of major and minor criteria for canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> has been proposed , out of which a patient needs to fulfil at least three in each group to be considered having canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> [6 ] . 
wilson et al (2003 ) reported <START:PHENOTYPE> increased nuchal translucency <END> in two patients [10 ] . 
since <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> is the only mowat-wilson syndrome feature that can be detected prenatally , molecular screening of the zinc finger e-box-binding homeobox 2 gene gene in prenatal isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> , has been carried out [50 ] . 
both methods being essentially two-dimensional share inherent limitations , as approximations are needed to quantify basic parameters like <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> volume and ejection fraction . 
on the second pregnancy , a nuchal translucency scan was reported as normal , but both fetal ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging examination showed <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> . 
galinier et al . prospectively followed 151 patients with chf , 48 % of which were diagnosed with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> [42 ] . 
in addition to progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> , clinical features include <START:PHENOTYPE> nail dystrophy <END> , abnormal skin <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> and mucosal leukoplakia ( knight et al. , 1998 ) . 
many of these studies did not differentiate between cad and non-ischemic causes of <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> , and were not powered for mortality in the non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> population . 
the cerebral magnetic resonance imaging ( magnetic resonance imaging ) showed <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> but the karyotype analysis was normal; 
the first child , a female , had <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> , dysmorphic features and <START:PHENOTYPE> developmental delay <END> . 
dyskeratosis congenita is a rare inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> bone marrow failure <END> syndrome . 
screening <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 gene for mutations all nine exons of the <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 gene and part of the flanking introns were pcr-amplified from genomic dna using the primers described by schiaffino et al. , with some modifications . 
in a group of non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> patients , fauchier et al . performed signal-averaged ecg in 131 patients with mean ejection fraction of 33 12 % and followed them for 54 41 months[43 ] . 
it has been concluded that zinc finger e-box-binding homeobox 2 gene is not the major gene for isolated <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> and that a particular attention to the facial features ( <START:PHENOTYPE> dysplastic ears <END> ) at ultrasound or fetopathological examination may help the diagnosis of mowat-wilson syndrome in fetuses with <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> . 
late potentials were not found to be predictive of overall mortality or <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> but did improve risk stratification for sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> . 
34% of the non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> patients were found to have late potentials (similar to the incidence of late potentials in patient s with cad ) . 
the lesions diagnosed included a mild <START:PHENOTYPE> microvesicular steatosis <END> and moderate <START:PHENOTYPE> bile duct proliferation <END> ( fig . 1 ) , multifocal mild periportal <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular necroses <END> accompanied by a moderate periportal bridging fibrosis ( fig . 2) , moderate periportal deposits of haemosiderin within macrophages and hepatocytes ( fig . 3 ) and spread of collagen fibers between the irregular and pleomorphic hepatocytes . 
in spite of their small size , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> in patients with high survivin mrna expression may be rapidly growing and metastasizing with increased resistance to chemotherapeutic regimens . 
[1 ] described quantitative analysis of mrna in archived and routine diagnostic tissues as being possible for <START:PHENOTYPE> melanoma <END> . 
as to <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> , high expression of survivin mrna in initial biopsy samples was especially common in cases with metastases . 
also , new primers were designed to confirm the single exon 6 deletion in family <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-2 ( forward 5 ' -gccttgcttgtgggctcaca-3 ' ; reverse 5 ' -tcaaagggcacctagcacagtct-3 ' ) . 
indirect diagnosis using <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-ca repeat the dinucleotide repeat sequence was amplified using primers and pcr conditons previously described . 
all individuals with 5p syndrome showed typical clinical features ( mainardi et al. , 2006 ) including , on review , the <START:PHENOTYPE> cat-like cry <END> and specific alteration of the voice , facial anomalies ( i .e . <START:PHENOTYPE> epicanthal folds <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microretrognathia <END> ) , and psychomotor and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> . 
the youngest participant with ridged fingernails was 2 years old and the youngest with <START:PHENOTYPE> early graying <END> of the hair was 12 years old . 
gene dosage analysis in family <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-2 the quantification was performed with a lightcycler instrument ( roche diagnostics ) using sybr green i for online measurement of pcr products . 
the method involves amplifications of a test exon located within the deleted region ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 exon 8 ) with unknown copy number and a reference locus ( exon 4 of the x-linked dmd gene ) with known copy number . 
in fact , several reports have described gene analyses using rna extracted from paraffin-embedded tissues from <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> [22] , ewing s sar coma [2 , 18 ] , small round-cell tumor [7] , synovial <START:PHENOTYPE> sarcoma <END> [26] , liposarcoma [11 ] , <START:PHENOTYPE> rhabdomyosarcoma <END> [8 ] and <START:PHENOTYPE> colon cancer <END> [23] . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> of the head of the animals in group 2 was histopathologically characterised by a severe orthokeratotic <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> , a moderate perivascular infiltration of eosinophilic granulocytes and a moderate interstitial <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> . 
survivin expression is also reportedly a useful prognostic marker in <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> , and patients showing survivin expression could potentially benefit from optimal selection of neoadjuvant chemotherapy [25] . 
a cross-sectional study of insured swedish dogs with a recorded diagnosis of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> ( canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> ) was performed . 
histopathologically , the goats in group 1 showed a moderate orthokeratotic <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> of the epidermis at the abdomen and the back , but no signs of inflammation . 
the only report on survivin expression in <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> used immunohistochemistry . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> deafness <END> has not been reported . 
genitourinary anomalies such as <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid scrotum <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vesicoureteral reflux <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hydronephrosis <END> may be present in the first years of life and may require surgery . 
the primer sequences for <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1-exon 8 and dmd-exon 4 have been previously described . 
the reactions were cycled 45 times with a 95 c denaturation for 15 sec , a 55 c ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 exon 8 ) or 65 c (dmd exon 4 ) annealing for 5 sec , and 72 c extension for 10 sec (dmd exon 4 ) or for 15 sec ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 exon 8 ) . 
previous studies have shown that heart rate variability ( heart rate variability ) is predictive of arrhythmic events following <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> ( table 2 ) . 
this syndrome has several phenotypic components including the characteristic cry that gives the syndrome its name , facial dysmorphology , <START:PHENOTYPE> speech delay <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> ( mainardi et al. , 2006 ) . 
the autonomic tone and reflexes after <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> ( autonomic tone and reflexes after <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> ) study showed that both decreased heart rate variability and baro-receptor sensitivity , another measure of autonomic tone , are associated with worse outcomes in patients after myocardial infarction [47 ] . 
in two of the ten pyometra bitches bile acid concentrations were elevated , which could result from an <START:PHENOTYPE> intrahepatic cholestasis <END> previously demonstrated in pyometra bitches [5 ] . 
the deletions involve the <START:PHENOTYPE> short arm <END> of chromosome 5 and usually encompass telomerase reverse transcriptase gene located at 5p15 .33 ( meyerson et al. , 1997 ; zhang et al. , 2003 ) . 
hr variability measures of autonomic function have been evaluated to assess risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> . 
the marburg <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> study [36] , confirmed that qt dispersion does not significantly risk stratify patients for sudden death . 
on the other hand , corrected qt dispersion ( qtc ) and adjusted qtc were not statistically different between those with and those without <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> during follow-up (8 0 21 vs 75 35 ms , and 27 6 vs 24 10 ms ) . 
one patient with a large deletion and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> in the neonatal period [11 ] , and a patient with aortic valvular stenosis [22] both died in the first month of life . 
qt dispersion was noted to be increased in patients with arrhythmic events compared to patients without an <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> during follow-up ( 76 17 vs 60 26 ms , p= 0.03 ) . 
during follow-up , 11 % of patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> had an arrhythmic event , defined as sustained vt , vf , or sudden death . 
grim et al . performed qt dispersion and related measures in 107 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and 100 controls without structural heart disease and followed them for 13 7 months [46 ] . 
these have long been the only useful prognostic factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> patients . 
the prognosis for patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> has typically been very poor , and clinically has been determined postoperatively by the response to chemotherapy and , in the past , by tumor size . 
in group 3 , a severe orthokeratotic <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> and a moderate atrophy of the epidermis and the integumentary appendages was observed at the abdomen and the back . 
in light of this , cyclosporine is used in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis as a steroid-sparing agent or for refractory generalized disease . 
group 2 animals were characterised by a crusty <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> of the head caused by candida spp . 
in a population of steroid-dependent patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , a randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled study of cyclosporine demonstrated significantly improved strength in the cyclosporine treatment group [50 ] . 
they found that the superior pvs were significantly dilated and were the commonest source of the ectopic beats initiating <START:PHENOTYPE> paroxysmal atrial fibrillation <END> . 
lin et al . studied the structure of the pulmonary veins in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> paroxysmal atrial fibrillation <END> that is initiated by pv ectopic beats [31 ] . 
they also suggested that these changes could provide a basis for microreentry and <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial arrhythmias <END> . 
in a long-term retrospective study , 96 % <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients improved with cyclosporine treatment , and steroids could be tapered or discontinued in 95 % patients [51 ] . 
satoh et al . demonstrated that increased atrial stretch in dogs might induce triggered activity resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> [32 ] . 
accordingly , relative contraindications to cyclosporine include poorly controlled <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> renal insufficiency <END> or failure , <START:PHENOTYPE> malignancy <END> , and inability to comply with blood monitoring or medication precautions . 
side effects of cyclosporine include <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> tremor <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hirsutism <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> gingival hypertrophy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> headaches <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> nausea <END> . 
the most common cyclosporine interactions and potential complications include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents with <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired renal function <END> , angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors eliciting <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkalemia <END> , and hmyasthenia gravis coa reductase inhibitors precipitating cholesterol-lowering agent <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> . 
the type i <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> in their classification , single broad wave fronts propagated uniformly across the ra . 
in 1994 , konings et al . classified <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> based on the patterns of atrial activation during <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [34 ] . 
therefore , in the present study , we investigated the pattern of connexin43 expression in abnormal spermatogenesis of human infertile testis in order to clarify the mechanism of <START:PHENOTYPE> male infertility <END> . 
chronic exposure to high doses of molybdenosis have been found to induce mild <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic renal failure <END> characterised by decreased glomerular filtration rates in rats [4 ] . 
normal control testes were obtained from 70 - to 75 -year-old patients undergoing orchidectomy for <START:PHENOTYPE> prostate cancer <END> ( n=3 ) . 
materials and methods patient profiles and tissue preparation testicular biopsy was performed in 29 infertile patients ( age : 16 45 years ; mean : 31.5 years ) with obstructive and non obstructive <START:PHENOTYPE> azoospermia <END> . 
other independent risk factors for one-year mortality included poor ejection fraction ( < 30% ) , increasing age , pre-operative <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysfunction <END> , peripheral vascular disease , prior cardiac surgery , emergency surgery , and female sex ( table 2 ) . 
obstructive <START:PHENOTYPE> azoospermia <END> was diagnosed in 4 cases . 
given a paucity of side effects , mycophenolate mofetil is used in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis both as a steroid-sparing agent and as initial immunotherapy in patients at risk for corticosteroid complications . 
three or more of the following criteria had to be fulfilled after the exclusion of other pruritic skin disorders in order for an animal to be re-classified as atopic : facial <START:PHENOTYPE> pruritus <END> , paw <START:PHENOTYPE> pruritus <END> , pruritic otitis , pruritic ventral <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> , pruritic generalized dermatitis , bilateral interdigital <START:PHENOTYPE> erythema <END> , debut before three years of age , peri -oral , -otic or -ophthalmic <START:PHENOTYPE> erythema <END> , and/or recurring dermatitis for more than two years . 
in 1997 , jais et al . reported nine patients with paroxysmal focal <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [35 ] . 
bacterial <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> and malassezia <START:PHENOTYPE> dermatitis <END> was ruled out by cytology and/or treatment of affected individuals . 
however , in a recently concluded multi-center , randomized , controlled trial of low dose prednisone versus low dose prednisone with mycophenolate mofetil , there was no clinically significant benefit in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil combined with low dose prednisone beyond that observed in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients treated with low dose prednisone only during the initial three month trial period . 
all were free of structural heart disease and had frequent episodes of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> despite the use of antiarrhythmic drugs . 
significantly improved strength in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients taking mycophenolate mofetil has been demonstrated in a retrospective case series [54 ] , in an open label pilot study in steroid dependent or refractory <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis [55 ] , and in a double-blind placebo control pilot trial in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis [56 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> was associated with runs of irregular atrial <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> or monomorphic extrasystoles . 
electrophysiological study demonstrated that all the <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial arrhythmias <END> were due to the same focus firing irregularly and exhibiting a consistent and centrifugal pattern of activation . 
there is a small increased risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoproliferative disorders <END> in transplant patients , and a case of central nervous system ( central nervous system ) <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> has been documented in a patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis after three years of mycophenolate mofetil treatment [58 ] . 
higher doses are associated with myelosuppression , and periodic blood counts are performed during treatment as surveillance against <START:PHENOTYPE> leukopenia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> . 
the standard mycophenolate mofetil dosage in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is 1000 1500 mg twice a day . 
this suggests a possible focal origin of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
the study population consisted of 45 consecutive patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> resistant to more than two drugs , at least one episode of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> every two days , receiving anticoagulant treatment , and frequent isolated atrial ectopic beats ( more than 700 per 24 hours ) . 
yet , hchorionic gonadotropin levels <START:PHENOTYPE> fall <END> during the second trimestheca externa cellsr , and elevatheca externa cellsd matheca externa cellsrnal midtrimestheca externa cellsr hchorionic gonadotropin is associatheca externa cellsd with himmature granulosa cellsher ratheca externa cellss of matheca externa cellsrnal and neonatal complicatheca intheca externa cellsrnaons ( pregnancy-induced hypertheca externa cellsnsion , preeclampsia , gestatheca intheca externa cellsrnaonal diabetheca externa cellss , and perinatal death ) . 
it is proposed that the secondary inflammatory response to the applied irritant comprising vasodilation , enzyme release , swelling , <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> , blebs , vesicles and suppuration may aid leucocytes and opsonins released in the inflamed area , leading to bacterial destruction . 
haissaguerre et al . in 1998 demonstrated that the pulmonary veins are an important source of spontaneous ectopic beats , initiating frequent paroxysms of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [12 ] . 
plasma exchange ( plasma exchange ) may be performed prior to starting corticosteroids to circumvent or minimize corticosteroid-related <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis exacerbations . 
an alternative dosing strategy of starting corticosteroids at a low initial dose with gradual dose increases has been advocated to reduce the risk for corticosteroid-related <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis exacerbations [44 ] . 
in addition , altered adrenergic innervation to the heart has been implicated in <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> following <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> ( chen et al. , 2001 ) . 
immunohistochemical analysis of connexin43 was performed on testicular biopsies from 29 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> azoospermia <END> ( n=23) and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> oligospermia <END> ( n=6 ) , who gave informed consent to this experiment . 
in addition to the cardiovascular regulatory effects of the superior cervical ganglion , it also plays a role in protecting the cerebrovasculature from <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> . 
we found that female sex , extent of coronary disease , peripheral vascular disease , hypercholesterolaemia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> were independent predictors of cardiac enzyme release three or more times the upper limit of the reference range ( table 3 ) . 
the main objective of this study was to validate the diagnosis of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> in a large animal insurance database against practice records . 
a validation of the diagnosis in the insurance claims database is needed as part of a larger project focusing on the epidemiology of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> among swedish dogs . 
however , the typically long delay of four to eight months from beginning treatment with azathioprine to improved strength in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is a significant liability to its usefulness , particularly in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients with progressive disease or functionally limiting symptoms . 
in 37 patients , at least one episode of sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> initiation lasting more than one minute was documented : the ectopic beat initiating <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> had a short coupling interval ( a p-on-t pattern ) and morphologic features similar to those of isolated ectopic beats . 
in dogs where electrocardiography , thoracic radiography , ultrasonography and laboratory parameters are normal , <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial necrosis <END> and ischemia may be difficult to detect clinically [5 ] . 
thus , local wound infections resulted in exacerbation of current illness and complications like <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatic encephalopathy <END> , subacute bacterial <START:PHENOTYPE> peritonitis <END> , multiple splenic abscesses , cavernous sinus <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombosis <END> and systemic bacterial <START:PHENOTYPE> sepsis <END> in our cases . 
conclusion the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> in oleic acid-induced acute lung injury animal model may be the result of pulmonary microthrombi and the drastic increase of pulmonary artery pressure . 
the resulting file included the following information for each canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> claim : date of claim , claim number , and gender , breed and date of birth of the animal . 
azathioprine is an effective agent for long-term immune modulation in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis as a steroid sparing drug or as initial immunotherapy . 
all reimbursed claims for canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> during 2002 were extracted from the insurance database , including both life-insurance and veterinary care claims . 
if the <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> did not spontaneously develop during electrophysiologic study or was not sufficiently sustained , physiologic procedures ( e.g. , valsalva 's maneuver or carotid-sinus massage ) , atrial pacing , pharmacologic agents or all three methods were tried . 
in cu-deficient calves , growth arrest and <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> are typical findings [27,45 ] . 
the role of ectopic beats in the initiation of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> was confirmed by on-site recording of a paroxysm of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
with long-term use , there is a small increased risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> [47 ] . 
side effects include dose dependent myelosuppression with <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocytic anemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> leukopenia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> , toxic hepatitis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> . 
hypersensitivity <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatitis <END> represents a rare , but serious idiosyncratic reaction , and patients with sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> taking azathioprine should be screened with serum amylase and lipase assays . 
our own study population , however , included 20.1 % with left main stem stenosis , 8.7% with ejection fraction <30% , 8.2% with cerebrovascular disease , and 2.7% with <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysfunction <END> ( serum creatinine >200 mmol and/or dialysis support ) . 
both studies however , originated from randomised control trials and excluded high-risk patients such as left main stem stenosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> , cerebrovascular disease , and significant renal impairment . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> male infertility <END> is induced by intrinsic factors such as <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic disorders <END> , that may cause the impairment of spermatogenesis at several stages of the differentiation of spermatogonia into spermatocytes [9 , 21 , 29] . 
introduction approximately one in 10 couples suffer from <START:PHENOTYPE> infertility <END> , and about half of this is attributable to the male [6 ] . 
studies have shown an association between the degree of increase in cardiac-specific troponin i concentrations an enlarged the size of <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarctions <END> in dogs [1 ,20] . 
patients with sustained ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> as recorded by their defibrillator had similar heart rate variability to those who had no arrhythmic events [48 ] . 
however , it has been suggested that <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced renal function <END> can cause an increase in cardiac-specific troponin i in the absence of myocardial cell damage [21] . 
heart rate variability was evaluated in 70 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillators implantation . 
measurement of cardiac troponin can be useful as a non-invasive method to determine suspected myocardial injury , for example in cases presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrhythmia <END> , severe <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> or multi organ dysfunctions . 
the weight of the evidence suggests that due to the poor positive predictive value of heart rate variability , this test has no role in the risk stratification for sudden death of patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> [48-50 ] . 
however , this decrease is associated with systolic ventricular function , and does not correlate with increased risk of ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> [49 ] . 
patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> have decreased heart rate variability . 
other trials have shown that in patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , heart rate variability was predictive of cardiac death but not ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> [49 ,50 ] . 
in human patients cardiac troponin measurement has also been demonstrated to be able to predict mortality in septic , <START:PHENOTYPE> end-stage renal disease <END> and acute <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> , and it is suggested to be a new mortality risk factor in intensive care units [7 ] . 
although effective , the use of cyclosporine in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis has been limited by its nephrotoxicity and numerous drug interactions . 
in eastern societies where the practice of modern medicine is inaccessible to a large part of the population , patients seek branding treatments for many medical conditions such as backache , sciatica , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> paralysis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> facial palsy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphadenopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> jaundice <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> migraine headaches <END> and sore throat [4 ] . 
however , the correctness of the specific diagnosis of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> has not previously been evaluated in this material and is unknown . 
if white blood cell count ( white blood cell count ) <START:PHENOTYPE> falls <END> below 350 0/mm3 , the dosage should be reduced , and if white blood cell count <START:PHENOTYPE> falls <END> below 3000/mm3 , azathioprine should be discontinued . 
menz et al . compared baroreceptor sensitivity against heart rate variability in a series of 179 patients including those with cad ( 27% ) and non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( 73% ) [51 ] . 
in dogs , increased plasma levels of cardiac troponin i have been demonstrated in cases of toxaemia , babesiosis , myocarditis , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pericardial effusion <END> and other heart diseases [10 ,11 ,14-16 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> erythrocyte macrocytosis <END> is expected and acceptable within the therapeutic dosage range . 
baroreceptor sensitivity testing studies of baroreceptor sensitivity ( baroreceptor sensitivity ) in the non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> population have not focused on risk stratification for sudden death until recently [36 ] . 
a study into the epidemiology of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> among insured swedish dogs revealed that age , breed , habitat , region and season of birth were factors which influenced the incidence rate of the disease [15 ] . 
an idiosyncratic allergic reaction with rash , <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nausea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> occurs in 10 15 % patients within the first three weeks of treatment [48 ,49 ] . 
kumar s et al provided a case report of a patient with progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> who underwent branding [2 ] . 
the study also showed an apparent increase in the incidence of canine <START:PHENOTYPE> atopic dermatitis <END> through time from 1995 to 2002 and a trend towards affected individuals from high-risk breeds dying at a higher rate than non-affected dogs from the same breeds . 
results common causes of mortality in necropsied laying hens included colibacillosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> erysipelas <END> , coccidiosis , red mite infestation , lymphoid leukosis and cannibalism . 
this assumption does not take into account compensatory mechanisms that serve to regulate [ca2+]i homeostasis , thus maintaining some degree of neuronal function in senescent neurones or during acute insults such as <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> ( murchinson & griffith , 1998 ; verkhratsky & toescu , 1998 ; lee et al. , 1999 ; griffith et al. , 2000 ; pottorf et al. , 2000a , 2002 ) . 
aging and alterations in control of neurotransmitter release in adrenergic neurones : multiple mechanisms the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> increases with age , and the single most important factor is rising systolic blood pressure ( faraci & heisted , 1998 ; abbott et al. , 2003 ; zhang et al. , 2003 ; lawes et al. , 2004 ) . 
onset of t wave alternans with heart rates below 100/minute conferred increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> or sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> , with a predictive accuracy of 78 % [52 ] . 
background factors that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease ( cardiovascular disease ) include <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , dyslipidemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> glucose intolerance <END> , type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> ( type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> . 
this makes it attractive in risk stratifying patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> . 
when these factors cluster in an individual is called metabolic syndrome ( metabolic syndrome ) , a complex disorder characterized by impaired glucose metabolism , dyslipidemia , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> [1 ] . 
background the main hypotheses of how deficiency in dystrophin triggers <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> suggest that the lack of this membrane cytoskeletal component weakens the sarcolemmal integrity , causes abnormal ca2+-homeostasis and/or impairs proper clustering of ion channel complexes [ , ] . 
the evidence to date suggests that baroreceptor sensitivity is not a reliable risk stratifier for sudden death in non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , and may not have additional benefit over other markers of autonomic tone , such as heart rate variability . 
kitamura et al described an increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> or sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> in patients with a history of non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> with occurrence of microvolt level t wave alternans at sufficiently low heart rate [52 ] . 
baroreceptor sensitivity was comparable in patients with cad and non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( 6 .1 3 vs 6 .9 5 ms/mmhg , p=ns ) . 
grimm , et al . performed an exhaustive trial of risk stratification techniques in patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , including baroreceptor sensitivity [36 ] . 
343 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> underwent baroreceptor sensitivity testing , with 26 patients (1 0% ) being excluded due to insufficient response to phenylephrine during baroreceptor sensitivity testing . 
risk factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> include age-related <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and changes in the structure of cerebral blood vessels ( abbott et al. , 2003 ; zhang et al. , 2003 ; lawes et al. , 2004 ) . 
hemorrhagic <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> accounts for about 10 % of cerebrovascular disease with a peak incidence near the age of 60 years and high probability of morbidity or mortality . 
methods anthropometric measurements , blood pressure , insulin , glucose and lipid profiles were determined in 606 individuals randomly chosen from a cross-sectional population-based epidemiological survey in the province of segovia in central spain ( castille) , recruited to investigate the prevalence of anthropometric and physiological parameters related to <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and other components of the metabolic syndrome . 
deficiency in dystrophin triggers the disintegration of complexes normally formed by the above listed sarcolemmal components and thereby renders muscle fibres from patients afflicted with duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> ( duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> ) more susceptible to necrosis [ , ] . 
in analogy to the pathobiochemical findings in duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> [ , ] , the dystrophic animal model mdx mouse also exhibits a drastic reduction in all dystrophin-associated glycoproteins in bulk skeletal muscle [ , ] . 
other medical complications include foreign body reaction , oral and tooth complications , <START:PHENOTYPE> aspiration <END> and hypoxia , <START:PHENOTYPE> edema <END> and swelling , infections and viral transmission including hepatitis and hiv [3 ,6-8 ] . 
in the long-term , branding procedures can cause disfigurement from <START:PHENOTYPE> contractures <END> ( especially over joint surfaces) , scars , <START:PHENOTYPE> hair loss <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> keloids <END> , orthokeratotic <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperkeratosis <END> , acanthosis and <START:PHENOTYPE> squamous cell carcinoma <END> ( marjolin 's ulcer ) . 
an abnormal increase in cytosolic ca2+- levels might trigger a drastic inc rease in net protein degradation and might be one of the initial steps in the molecular pathogenesis of inherited <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> . 
the increased <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> develops within 7 10 days after treatment begins and may last for up to one week before strength improves [40 ,43 ] . 
cysteine protease calpain 10 ( calpain 10 ) has been associated with type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> , increased body mass index ( body mass index ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome ) , a reproductive disorder of women in which isunlin resistance seems to play a pathogenic role . 
that the other members of the dystrophin -glycoprotein complex , besides dystrophin , play a role in the duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> pathology , is demonstrated by the fact that primary abnormalities in sarcoglycans and laminin are responsible for certain forms of <START:PHENOTYPE> limb-girdle muscular dystrophy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital muscular dystrophy <END> , respectively [ , ] . 
patients at greatest risk for morbidity related to this phenomenon are those with more severe bulbar or <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized weakness <END> and/or compromised respiratory function . 
in contrast to muscle , much less is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying <START:PHENOTYPE> brain abnormalities <END> in the most frequent neuromuscular disease in humans [ , ] . 
calpain 5 gene has been previously associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome by our group . 
corticosteroid-related <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis exacerbations may produce transient but potentially serious increases in myasthenic <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> in up to 15 % of patients beginning treatment with corticosteroids [40 ] . 
the strong negative predictive value of sustained t wave alternans demonstrated in this study at heart rates <11 0 bpm suggests a role of t wave alternans testing in risk stratification of patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( table 3 ) . 
further studies to look at larger , more diverse populations , long-term follow-up , and the benefits of serial t wave alternans measurements will clarify the role of this test in risk stratification of patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> . 
background genes implicated in common complex disorders such as <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> ( type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> ) or cardiovascular diseases are not disease specific , since clinically related disorders also share genetic components . 
a recent study by hohnloser et al looked at 137 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> referred to a single center for diagnosis or management of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> or evaluation of symptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> [55 ] . 
unfortunately t wave alternans can be indeterminate in as many as 20% of patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> [52 ,53 ] . 
it may be speculated that these alterations contributed to the maldigestion and <START:PHENOTYPE> malnutrition <END> and also the decreased feed intake and loss of body weight in the goats [18 ] . 
the lesions in the liver may have been responsible for the <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> and maldigestion observed in animals in group 3 [ 19 ] . 
when compared to similar patients with ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> , it appears that the non-ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> patient has a less certain clinical course in terms of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> . 
[ 19 ] have reported strong evidence of linkage within 11q14 , the chromosomal region that contains calpain 5 gene gene in a large set of finnish affected sibling pair families with type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> . 
in addition , we identified several calpain 5 gene alleles associated with phenotypic differences observed between <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome patients , such as the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , cardiovascular complications , and familial antecedents of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> aggregation . 
however , some coronar artery anomalys are associated with clincal manifestations such as <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> , myocardial ischemia ( fixed or episodic ) or <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> [3 ] . 
patients undergoing surgery that involved heart valve repair or replacement , resection of a <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular aneurysm <END> or other surgical procedure were not included . 
measurement of these variables when studied along with other risk factors has shown superior risk prediction for <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> . 
the clinical implications of recently revised diagnostic criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> have been recognised and the need for prognostic evaluation of peri-operative cardiac enzyme release specifically emphasised [18 ,19 ] . 
[13 ] and our group [14 ] independently published association of calpain 10 gene with <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome . 
conclusion as the treatment of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> from non-ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> chf becomes more refined , it is expected that death from pump failure will be delayed , and risk stratification of these patients for arrhythmic death will become more important . 
at the time of the study , laying hens in sweden were vaccinated against marek 's disease , avian encephalomyelitis and infectious <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchitis <END> during the rearing period and against infectious <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchitis <END> regularly during the laying period . 
peri-operative <START:PHENOTYPE> electrocardiographic changes <END> such as t wave inversion , left or right bundle branch block , and new q waves have poor sensitivity and specificity for <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> [7-9] , and appear not to be associated with reduced medium and long term survival [9 ,10 ] . 
in a previous work , we analyzed four calpain 5 gene gene variants ( rs948976 , rs4945140 , rs2233546 and rs2233549 ) in 148 <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome women [18 ] . 
the most effective treatment and prophylaxis for <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> is implantation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillators . 
cardiac specific biochemical markers of myocardial injury are attractive surrogates for clinical outcomes following cardiac surgery , but lack robust thresholds for association with a diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> and reduced survival [11 ] . 
we found that specific calpain 5 gene haplotypes were overrepresented in <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome patients . 
due to the considerable cost considerations of these devices it would probably be uneconomical to place these devices in all patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> . 
the most recent european society of cardiology/american college of cardiology joint guideline did not specify threshold values of post-operative cardiac enzyme release that defined <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> following coronary artery bypass graft ( coronary artery bypass surgery ) surgery [12 ] . 
a reanalysis of calpain 10 gene in a larger <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome population , allowed us to identify specific haplotypes associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome patients [15 ] . 
furthermore , calpain 10 has been associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> and elevated body mass index ( body mass index ) by different groups [16 ,17 ] . 
in the groups 1 and 3 , a mild fatty degeneration of the liver , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular necrosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> periportal fibrosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> bile duct proliferation <END> and haemosiderosis were observed . 
most of the current trials of risk stratification for patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , with the exception of the sudden cardiac death-heft trial , are underpowered and non-randomized . 
[9 ] have recently reported a germline missense mutation in the fem1a gene in a <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome woman that was absent in 198 control chromosomes ; 
the authors propose fem1a as a candidate gene for <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome . 
we showed that the presence of as little as 0.1 ng/ml of phorbol myristate acetate in tissue culture restored the ability of weakly inducible ls1034 <START:PHENOTYPE> colon carcinoma <END> cells to express major histocompatibility complex class ii in response to ifn-gamma (10 0 10,000 iu/ml ) in a dose-dependent manner . 
background aside from muscle , brain is also a major expression site for dystrophin , the protein whose abnormal expression is responsible for duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> . 
the calpain 5 gene homologue calpain 10 was identified as a type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> susceptibility locus by horikawa et al . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive impairments <END> are frequently associated with this genetic disease , we therefore studied the fate of brain and skeletal muscle dystrophins and dystroglycans in dystrophic animal models . 
we report a case , where a 39-year old woman presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> during phycial exertion . 
[10 ] and has been shown to be related to proinsulin processing , insulin secretion and <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> [11 ,12 ] . 
the effect of phorbol myristate acetate was not observed in two other poorly responding cell lines , msto-211h mesothelioma and hepg2 <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> , and was abrogated by relatively high concentrations of protein kinase c inhibitors staurosporine (10 0 nm ) and gf 109203x ( 1,000 nm ) . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> in adult life may be the first clinical presentation in patients with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery . 
conclusion in this study we showed that ifn-gamma-inducibility of major histocompatibility complex class ii antigens in weakly inducible ls1034 <START:PHENOTYPE> colorectal carcinoma <END> cell line can be rescued by concomitant incubation with protein kinase c agonists . 
the usual clinical course is severe left sided <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve insufficiency <END> presenting during the first months of life . 
appropriate primary prevention and secondary prevention of <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrest <END> in this population will require effective risk stratification to allow delivery of life saving therapy in an economically reasonable fashion . 
interestingly , the knockout mice of one of the three mammalian homologues of the c.elegans fem-1 gene , fem1b , display <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal glucose homeostasis <END> , with <START:PHENOTYPE> abnormal glucose tolerance <END> tests and defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion [8 ] . 
athymic mice bearing mda-mb-231 human <START:PHENOTYPE> breast carcinoma <END> xenografts , were fed fish oil concentrate ( fish oil concentrate ) or control diets , with and without supplemental vitamin e (2000 iu /kg diet ) and were sacrificed both before and after doxorubicin (doxorubicin ) treatment to evaluate factors involved in tumor growth suppression . 
in humans , the fem1a gene maps to chromosome 19p13.3 , a region linked to <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome ( <START:PHENOTYPE> polycystic ovary <END> syndrome ) , a common endocrine disorder of women of reproductive age , characterized by chronic anovulation , <START:PHENOTYPE> infertility <END> , hyperandrogenemia and frequently , <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> resulting in an increased prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , cardiovascular disease and type 2 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , reason why polycystic ovary syndrome is consider a phenotype closely related to metabolic syndrome . 
as the patient was somnolent <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothermia <END> treatment was initiated and a subsequent cerebral ct scan was found to be normal . 
the mobile acute care team arrived 2 minutes after the alarm and found <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> . 
we also comment on their potential use as noninvasive markers for differentiating simple <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis as well as on their potential future therapeutic role in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis . 
introduction nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease ( nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease ) is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and is closely associated with visceral <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> [1 3] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> skin tags <END> are especially common around the neck ; 
for comparative purposes and in order to characterize the genetic animal models of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> used in this study , the fate of dystrophin-associated glycoproteins was evaluated in mdx and mdx-3cv skeletal muscle fibres and forebrain . 
histopathology reveals the typical features of a <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> , but the <START:PHENOTYPE> skin tags <END> do not generally change in sin the radiation fieldor shape . 
one of the positive effects of this situation is that authors from this background described useful clinical diagnostic criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> . van vlimmeren et al . 
recently , wilson et al . reported the occurrence of hairy skin <START:PHENOTYPE> patches <END> ( discrete <START:PHENOTYPE> patches <END> of unusually long pigmented hair ) on the skin of three patients affected by gorlin syndrome from two unrelated families with confirmed heterozygous mutations in the ptch1 gene , suggesting that the <START:PHENOTYPE> patches <END> may represent a sign associated with the syndrome [27] . 
although <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> has a very low incidence , craniofacial clinics are deluged with infants with deformational <START:PHENOTYPE> plagiocephaly <END> [14 , 15 , 37 ] . 
during childhood she had been followed due to mild <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> thought to be due to <START:PHENOTYPE> endocardial fibroelastosis <END> . 
other skin signs are nodular or <START:PHENOTYPE> patch <END> lesions , and benign dermal cysts . 
echocardiography showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokinesia <END> of the left ventricular anterior wall with an ejection fraction of 35 % and normal heart valvular function . 
it is noteworthy , that nervous tissue showed both histopathological lesions and the presence of viral antigen in experiment i , while in experiment ii in spite of severe histopathological changes , classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus antigen was not detected . 
in this study , the possibility exits that resistance of the sv-40 transformed cell line to dna damage may not be the same as that of human primary lung epithelium , because sv-40 large t antigen simultaneously disables the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( prb ) and p53 tumor suppressor pathways . 
a number of recent papers described features to distinguish <START:PHENOTYPE> craniosynostosis <END> from deformational <START:PHENOTYPE> plagiocephaly <END> . 
although a formal clinical classification system and research standards have been established for <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , [6 ] there are no widely accepted formal diagnostic criteria . 
the most important elements of diagnosis are clinical history and examination findings of fluctuating and fatigable <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , particularly involving extraocular and bulbar muscles . 
in some patients , the lining of these odontogenic keratocysts has lost the normal gene for nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome , whin the radiation fieldretaining the mutant allele . 
the exponential increase of <START:PHENOTYPE> plagiocephaly <END> in the last decade , related to the recommendations to put babies on their back to sleep , is reflected in the objectives of recent studies [4 , 6 , 37 , 41 ] . 
the prevalence of nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease is 10 25% in the western world [4 6] ; 
the term nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease encompasses a wide spectrum of liver histology , from simple <START:PHENOTYPE> steatosis <END> to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ) , which can progress to <START:PHENOTYPE> cirrhosis <END> and its complications [7 ] . 
distinguishing nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease from non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is essential in the clinical setting , as nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease seems to have a benign course in the absence of co-existing liver disease , in sharp contrast to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis , which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and a reduced life expectancy [9 , 10 ] . 
galli until the second infection a slight weight <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> was seen in all groups including the control group . 
cytokines play a pivotal role in pathogenesis and severity of nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease . 
this may progress to <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> during periods of increased myocardial oxygen consumption . 
an interesting aspect of this syndrome is that some of the developmental defects ( e.g . jaw cysts ) appear to have two genetic hits but without developing into a true <START:PHENOTYPE> malignancy <END> . 
in adult life symptoms may range from dyspnoea , <START:PHENOTYPE> chest pain <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> exercise intolerance <END> to <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> due to acute ischemia during exercise or malignant ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> generated from myocardial scar tissue [6 ,7] . 
patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome , and other similar syndromes have a constitutional ( germlin the radiation field defect in the dna sequence in one of the two copies of a tumor suppressor gene . 
case presentation a 39-year old woman experienced a sudden <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of consciousness <END> during coitus . 
data from patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> support the knudson two-hit hypothesis ; 
the present results show that the in situ hybridisation technique , developed in this study , is a useful tool for the detection of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus in formalin fixed , paraffin embedded tissue samples . 
most non-nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome keratocysts are isolated lesions , but in nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome the keratocysts are commonly multiple , from 1 to 30 , and the average number is 5 . 
similarly to the observation of choi and chae [18 ]in situ hybridisation assays provide sensitive means for studying the pathogenesis of acute and chronic classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus infections . 
the typical clinical course is severe left sided <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> and significant <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve insufficiency <END> , presenting at the age of one to two months , where the pulmonary vascular resistance drops . 
odontogenic keratocysts ( odontogenic keratocysts ) are the most consistent and representatin the radiation fieldsigns of nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome in the first and the second decades of lin the radiation field odontogenic keratocysts are detected in patients under 10 years of age [5 ,12 ] : 13% of patients develop a jaw cyst by the age of 10 years and 51 % by the age of 20 years . 
loss of heterozygosity at the ptch1 locus has been observed in almost 90 % of hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> . 
initial symptoms are <START:PHENOTYPE> feeding difficulties <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> irritability <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphoresis <END> , tachypnoea and <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> . 
these data suggest that lesions may start to develop as early as at 7 or 8 years of age and underlin the radiation fieldthe fact that keratocysts in patients affected by nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome arin the radiation fieldearlier than those in healthy subjects [28,29] . 
various physical anomalies ( <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid rib <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> ) apparently need only one hit . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> chest pain <END> due to myocardial ischemia could be mistaken with infantile colic . 
in nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome , various tumors and <START:PHENOTYPE> hamartomas <END> ( bcc , odontogenic keratocysts , <START:PHENOTYPE> meningiomas <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ovarian fibromas <END> ) exhibit loss of heterozygosity [123,124] , but other lesions do not , for example , <START:PHENOTYPE> palmar pits <END> [125] . 
in control experiments , cryosections were labeled with antibodies to the membrane cytoskeletal protein spectrin , a component established not to be affected in <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> . 
the molecular biology of cancers in nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome is similar to that of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> , the prototypical pediatric cancer syndrome , which is characterin the radiation field by mutations in a recessin the radiation fieldoncogene . 
the formation of reactive nitrogen species ( reactive nitrogen species ) , including peroxynitrite and nitrogen dioxide ( no2) , may be the prime reason in many cases why no can contribute to the etiology of inflammatory lung diseases , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> . 
after the definitive diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis , <START:PHENOTYPE> renal dysfunction <END> can be explained by <START:PHENOTYPE> glomerulonephritis <END> due to deposition of immune complexes , while changes in electrocardiogram may be also explained by the occurrence of myocarditis caused by leishmania . 
therefore , affection of the myocardium and , as a consequence , impairment of the cardiac function must be added to the <START:PHENOTYPE> plethora <END> of lesions and clinical signs that may be present in dogs with the visceral form of this chronic parasitic disease . 
in the case we report here , the occurrence of subcutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> oedemas <END> was attributed to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> as a result of <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> with protein loss , with changes in the electrocardiogram that correlated with this initial diagnosis . 
there is mounting evidence that cytokines secreted from adipose tissue , namely , adipokines , are implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease . 
nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease ( nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease ) is the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and can vary from benign <START:PHENOTYPE> steatosis <END> to end-stage liver disease . 
in contemporary series of thymectomy for <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , mortality is less than 1% . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> ) or <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrest <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> is therefore a major clinical presentation of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in adults . 
preoperative plasma exchange or intravenous immunoglobulin is performed to improve strength in patients with moderate or severe generalized or bulbar <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis or in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis-related <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory insufficiency <END> [87 ] . 
objective findings include <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomegaly <END> on chest x-ray , and ecg may display an anterolateral infarct pattern . 
about 30% of nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome patients have two or more types of bcc patterns ( morphea-lin the radiation field solid , superficial , cystic , adenoid , fibroepithelial ) [4 ] . 
in muscle-specific tyrosine kinase <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , no <START:PHENOTYPE> thymomas <END> have been reported to date , and findings in recent clinical series raise doubt about benefits of thymectomy in muscle-specific tyrosine kinase <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients [1 ,2 ,4] . 
in infants , most of the patients with corrected anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery show normalization of both ventricular function and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve insufficiency <END> [12 ,13 ] . 
nearly 85 % of patients with initial ocular symptoms progress to develop <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of bulbar and limb muscles within the first three years [10 ,89 ] . 
several mutations of the ptch1 gene have been in the radiation fieldtified in patients with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome [101-118 ] , and , in those with <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastomas <END> that are apparently not hereditary [119 ,120] . 
if left untreated , <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> can lead to disfigurment , especially on the face . 
the finding of interventricular conduction delay has been associated with clinical instability and an increased risk of death in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> [5-8 ] . 
prognosis most patients develop initial symptoms of extraocular <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> with asymmetric <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> diplopia <END> . 
wang and goldberg reported a patient with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome who developed multiple polypoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> ( polypoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> ) in the perin the radiation fieldm , leading to the recommendation that the perin the radiation fieldm , perianal , and genital areas should be included in the routin the radiation fieldexamination of patients with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome [24] . 
complications include <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> due to myasthenic crisis in 6% , infection in 11 % , and recurrent laryngeal or phrenic nerve injury in 2% [88 ] . 
this dyssynchronous pattern of ventricular contraction is believed to contribute to the pathophysiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> , reducing the already diminished contractile reserve of the heart [3 ] . 
seven promoters drive the tissue-specific expression of various dystrophin protein (dystrophin protein ) isoforms from the human duchenne <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> gene , i.e . 
these are factors , which should be considered in the comparative pathology and diagnosis of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> . 
introduction approximately 30 percent of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> have interventricular conduction delay such as left or right bundle-branch block , leading to loss of coordination of ventricular contraction [1 ,2 ] . 
curative techniques : the maze operation - ablation of reentrant <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> surgical maze procedure the understanding of the electrophysiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> as consisting of multiple random circulating reentrant wavelets was the basis for the development of the maze operation . 
it has also been shown to benefit drug refractory angina in <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> . 
this operation underwent serial modifications beginning with the left atrial isolation procedure in 1980 and progressing to the maze iii operation which resulted in higher incidence of postoperative sinus rhythm , improved long term sinus node function , decreased need for pacing , less <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> recurrence and improved long-term atrial transport function . 
additional <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> was observed for the group infected additionally with a . 
it has improved exercise tolerance and new york heart association functional class in such patients in sinus rhythm and a recent meta-analysis has also shown mortality benefits in <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> . 
recently benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy have also been observed in <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> patients who do not have wide qrs complexes on electrocardiogram ( ekg ) . 
a weight <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> was seen for the two groups infected with e . 
the right atrial modification technique has met with good success in cases where the <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> is triggered by a short run of atrial flutter or in cases when a single macro-reentrant circuit is located in the right atrium and has an unstable cycle length . 
in our patient with previous sternotomy for repair of type a <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic dissection <END> and radiographic evidence of adherence of heart and aorta to the back of the sternum , establishment of cardiopulmonary bypass prior to the sternotomy was crucial . 
in an effort to overcome this difficulty , we employed an endophenotypic measure that is (i ) highly heritable ( is disrupted ) highly sensitive to several core dimensions of various <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric disorders <END> , and ( is disruptedi ) dependent on specific anatomical brain areas . 
in agreement with the clinical finding of <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> , large numbers of single megakaryocytes were observed in the red pulp . 
on the other hand , left atrial modification has not been rewarding because of faulty technique and increased risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> . 
if significant associations were found , then it would be reasonable to use the attention network test for exploratory genetic studies aimed at the identification of polymorphisms that contribute to the risk of various <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric disorders <END> . 
although the 7- repeat allele has often been associated with attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder , it may not contribute to a loss of attentional efficiency , but perhaps to other dimensions that underlie the development of attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder . 
in the heart , the myocardium showed a dense accumulation of macrophages between the muscle fibers ( fig 1 ) and also areas of cardiac <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> , degeneration and loss of myocardiocytes ( fig 2 ) . 
swanson and colleaguesshowed that attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder subjects with the 7- repeat allele did not show <START:PHENOTYPE> cognitive deficits <END> on cued-detection , color-word and go-change neuropsychological tasks designed to measure various attentional functions . 
in experimental studies , left posterior atrial modification with rapid atrial pacing and left atrial lines ( in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral regurgitation <END> model ) has been reported successful . 
the finding that the 4- repeat absent group showed lower executive attention scores is consistent with previous findings on attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder populations . 
in the liver , small aggregates of large macrophages were found throughout the parenchyma and , in the kidneys , we found evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis <END> , as well as of interstitial infiltration of inflammatory mononuclear cells . 
however , femoral artery cannulation in <START:PHENOTYPE> aortic dissection <END> may lead to visceral malperfusion and retrograde embolisation . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> nevi <END> are flesh colored , reddish brown or pearly , and the groups resemble moles , <START:PHENOTYPE> skin tags <END> , an ordinary nevus , cell <START:PHENOTYPE> nevi <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> hemangiomas <END> . 
the sera from all the healthy controls were negative in the <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> test . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> test was repeated after two-three months , with the same positive result and the same indirect immunofluorescence-antinuclear antibodies pattern . 
when comparing the <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> results and different clinical signs , there were no symptoms that were clearly over-represented according to <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positivity/negativity . 
multiple <START:PHENOTYPE> nevi <END> are present in 30 5 0 % of patients under 20 years of age , rising to 70 % in patients over the age of 20 years . 
another dog had previously ( before entrance into the study ) also been diagnosed as having <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothyroidism <END> and was receiving thyroxin treatment . 
based on the clinical history , with a documented episode of <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> ) without evidence of acute ischemia , a cardioverter defibrillator ( icd ) was implanted . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> determination twenty-three of the tolling retrievers with signs of disease ( i .e . 70% ) displayed a positive indirect immunofluorescence-antinuclear antibodies test , while the remaining 10 dogs showed a negative result ( fig 1 , table 1 ) . 
in adult life patients with anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery could present with symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral valve insufficiency <END> , angina or <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> . 
furthermore , the typical malformatin the radiation fieldpattern of nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome suggests that the gene has a fundamental function in controlling growth and development of normal tissues [100] . 
cardiac resynchronization therapy ( cardiac resynchronization therapy ) is a new modality that involves synchronization of ventricular contraction and has shown a lot of promise in managing symptomatic patients of <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> who are on optimal medical therapy and have interventricular conduction delay ( interventricular conduction delay ) . 
there are two potential substrates for <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> in these patients . 
firstly , areas with scar tissue after previous <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarctions <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarctions <END> ) may alter the conduction in the left ventricle and become arrhythmogenic . 
approximately 5 0 % of nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome patients have allelic losses including this sin the radiation field[97 ] . 
secondly , <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> could be triggered from an acute ischemic event during exercise , where coronary steal phenomena may cause inadequate perfusion . 
newer non-pharmacological therapies for <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> are being evaluated for patients of <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> ) . 
despite these therapeutic advances , it is generally accepted that current therapies do not adequately address the clinical need of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> , and additional strategies are being developed . 
etiology nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome is a hereditary condition caused by mutations in the ptch1 gene and is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner with high penetrance and variable expressivity [93 ,94 ] . 
mechanical support with left ventricular assist devices and heart transplantation are reserved for the minority of patients who have severely decompensated <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> . 
the left atrium is now frequently the target for curative <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> ablation since the reporting of pulmonary veins as triggers for <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> ( pulmonary vein ablation is discussed later in the article ) . 
thus , the viral antigen demonstration is very important in the early detection of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus infections , especially in cases caused by moderately virulent viruses . 
elvan et al . reported successful cure of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> by application of radiofrequency current to five epicardial sites and one endocardial site ( coronary sinus ) in a canine model of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> induced by burst atrial pacing [20] . 
multifocal areas of <START:PHENOTYPE> pallor <END> affected the left ventricular and septal myocardium . 
the lack of any association is surprising given previous reports of associations with attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder and other disorders . 
swartz et al . reported creating linear atrial lesions in humans with chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> using the drag technique [23] . 
kalman et al . showed that the production of linear atrial lesions reduced the energy requirement for cardioversion of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> and in some cases to its termination [22] . 
abdominal lesions included <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> and fibrotic , cortical striation and the presence of small whitish nodular foci in the renal cortex . 
this role of monoamine oxidase in alerting may be related to the findings of lim et al. ,showing a significant association of the monoamine oxidase locus to susceptibility for <START:PHENOTYPE> bipolar disorder <END> . 
side effects include volume overload , particularly for patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> valvular heart disease <END> , solute-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> renal failure <END> , especially in patients with preexisting <START:PHENOTYPE> renal insufficiency <END> or diabetic <START:PHENOTYPE> nephropathy <END> [71 ] , and idiosyncratic reactions such as <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , chills , <START:PHENOTYPE> nausea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , vascular <START:PHENOTYPE> headaches <END> , and aseptic <START:PHENOTYPE> meningitis <END> . 
clinical description many different signs and symptoms may be associated with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome ( table 2 ) . 
noteworthy , the development of the classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> varied remarkably in group ii between the individual animals , ranging from a symptomless infection to typical , fatal cases . 
high infusion rates may be associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombosis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> [72 ] . 
however , one randomized trial found no added benefit for doses of 2 gm/kg over 1 gm/kg for <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis exacerbations [70 ] . 
thus , in children in which this tumor is diagnosed , nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome should be suspected and a careful examination for other signs of the syndrome should be performed in order to rule it out [6 ] . 
clinical manin the radiation fieldtations include <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> ) , which may appear very early ( 2 years of age ) [16 ] ; 
early onset <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> may be the presenting sign of nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome ; 
radiation therapy for <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> can induce invasin the radiation fieldbasal cell carcinomas in the radiation field ( in the radiation field , from the nape to base of the spin the radiation field [83 ] . 
from post infection day 4 all the infected animals showed typical classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> lesions . 
there is some evin the radiation fieldce that <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastomas <END> associated with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome have a better clinical outcome than those found in isolation [47 , 81 ,82] , with the possibility of spontaneous recovery [82 ] . 
serum immunoglobulin quantitation to screen for <START:PHENOTYPE> iga deficiency <END> is recommended , since intravenous immunoglobulin preparations contain traces of iga . 
due to the lack of clinical signs of diagnostic importance , special attention has to be paid to detect successfully and immediately such cases of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus infection in the field . 
thymectomy thymectomy has been widely performed in an effort to achieve medication-free remission in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis following blalock 's early observations of remissions following thymectomy in non-thymomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis [73 ,74 ] . 
one of the tolling retriever patients showed a <START:PHENOTYPE> mild thrombocytopenia <END> (102 109 ) with a concomitant leucopoenia ( 1.7 109 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphocytopenia <END> ( 0.4 109 ) . 
skin <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> may arin the radiation fieldin various stages of the syndrome : most often they appear between puberty and 35 years of age [16 ] , but cases have been reported in 3 or 4 year-old patients [5 ,12 ] ; 
in 1968 , schweisguth et al . reported fetal <START:PHENOTYPE> rhabdomyoma <END> [84 ] . 
there are several reports that support an increased incin the radiation fieldce of other neoplasms or <START:PHENOTYPE> hamartomas <END> , such as leiomyomas of bowel and mesentery , <START:PHENOTYPE> leiomyosarcoma <END> , adrenal cystic <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphangioma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid adenoma <END> , lymphangiomyoma , <START:PHENOTYPE> melanoma <END> , ameloblastoma , craniopharyngioma , mesenchymoma , hodgkin 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> , non-hodgkin 's <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphoma <END> , seminoma , paratesticular pseudotumor , schwannoma , pleiomorphic adenoma of parotid , adenoid cystic carcinoma of salivary gland , and adrenal tumors [90-92 ] . 
five of the tolling retriever patients demonstrated aspartate aminotransferase values above the reference range , with only one of them showing clinical signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> myositis <END> . 
one antinuclear antibodies-negative canine patient had severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminaemia <END> ( 9 g/l ) . 
the time to improved strength following intravenous immunoglobulin infusions is somewhat variable , as demonstrated by a trial of intravenous immunoglobulin given to prepare <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients for thymectomy in which maximal response was delayed by up to 19 days [69 ] . 
palmar and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> plantar pits <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopic calcifications <END> of the falx cerebri . 
various low-frequency neoplasms , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastomas <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> meningiomas <END> , and ovarian and <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac fibromas <END> have been also reported ( table 2 ) . 
intravenous immunoglobulin trials in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis are summarized in a cochrane review [68 ] . 
the disorder is also characterin the radiation field by congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal abnormalities <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> with <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip <END> and/or palate , and eye anomalies . 
although elevated intraocular pressure likely results in inner retinal cell death in <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , deficiency of inner retinal cells in bmp4+ /- heterozygotes is at least partly a developmental phenomenon . 
they used radiofrequency microbipolar coagulation to produce conduction blocks along incision lines in keeping with the surgical maze iii procedure as an adjunct to valve surgery in 18 patients in <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> undergoing surgery for rheumatic valvular disease . 
pathological actheca intheca externa cellsrnavatheca intheca externa cellsrnaon of microglia has been reportheca externa cellsd in a wide range of conditheca intheca externa cellsrnaons such as alzheimer 's disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> cerebral ischemia <END> , prion diseases , multheca intheca externa cellsrnaple sclerosis , aids dementheca intheca externa cellsrnaa , and other degeneratheca intheca externa cellsrnave neurological diseases . 
their study population included patients with rheumatic heart disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
it can also cause superior corneal pannus , <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal ulceration <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> iritis <END> . 
there appears to be a relationship with increased sun exposure , and therefore <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> are most lin the radiation fieldy to appear on the sun-exposed parts of the body , but non-exposed areas may also be involved . 
no <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac abnormalities <END> were evident on preoperative physical examinations . 
controversies related to thymectomy in non-thymomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis include the ideal timing of the procedure with respect to <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis onset , course , and patient age , the optimal surgical technique , whether patients with exclusively ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis should undergo thymectomy , and whether patients with seronegative or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis benefit from thymectomy . 
clinically , they may vary from flesh-colored papules to ulcerating plaques and may be mistaken for <START:PHENOTYPE> skin tags <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> nevi <END> , or <START:PHENOTYPE> hemangiomas <END> . 
because of increased surgical risk and reduced life span , thymectomy is rarely performed in patients at greater than age 60 years for non-thymomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> may vary in number ( from a few to lin the radiation fieldally thousands ) and range in sin the radiation fieldfrom 1 to 10 mm in diameter . 
unlike common viral <START:PHENOTYPE> conjunctivitis <END> , chlamydia infection tends to affect the cornea in terms of peripheral subepithelial infiltrates and diffuse superficial punctuate <START:PHENOTYPE> keratitis <END> . 
there is evidence to suggest that the best clinical responses occur if thymectomy is performed early in the course of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis [81 ] , though this may attribute to a non-linear remission rate [77 ] , as remission is more likely to occur shortly after diagnosis rather than with more chronic disease [82 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis ( <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis ) is a rare , autoimmune neuromuscular junction disorder . 
however , the incin the radiation fieldce in whin the radiation field is also variable with some studies showing a lower prevalence (30% ) , probably due to protectin the radiation fieldskin <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> [11 ] , as already established for african-american patients [6 , 19 ] . 
preseptal <START:PHENOTYPE> cellulitis <END> if left untreated has the potential to cross the septal barrier and spread to the posterior orbit resulting in fatal complications . 
the role for thymectomy in non-thymomatous ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is also uncertain [83 ,84 ] . 
the incin the radiation fieldce varies win the radiation fieldy among ethnic groups : only about 40% of black patients affected by nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome manin the radiation fieldt <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> , whin the radiation fieldin whin the radiation field they are reported in up to 90 % of cases . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> rhabdomyosarcomas <END> are also present in 15 % of min the radiation fieldhaplodeficient for ptch1 [79 ] . 
other tumors tumors in patients with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome include <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> fibroma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> rhabdomyosarcoma <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> rhabdomyosarcoma <END> ) [76-78 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> encephalitis <END> , another major histopathological lesion , was seen only in groups i and ii . 
the inflammation under the upper eyelid may present as <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> due to the increased weight of the inflamed tissues . 
these days , when the animals are already classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus infected but neither clinical signs , nor histopathological changes are yet observed , creates an important risk-period in the safe early diagnosis of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> . 
in one of these cases ( later diagnosed with myocarditis and disseminated bacterial infection ) the cardiac troponin i levels increased from 0.9 g l-1 preoperatively to 180 g l-1 the following day when also heart <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> was also detected . 
conduction defects ( in the radiation field , <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> ) may also be present due to involvement of the intraventricular septum [75 ] . 
the incin the radiation fieldce of <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> in evans ' series was 1 % to 2% [5 ] . 
although it is considered as an anorexigenic hormone , its levels are elevated in <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> as a result of resistance to its actions [24] . 
herzberg and wiskemann first pointed out the association of nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome with <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> in 1963 [80] . 
as well as the potential urogenital complications including ectopic pregnancy and salpingitis which may lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> infertility <END> , it is also associated with other serious non genital manifestations including perihepatitis . 
to date , there have been no prospective , randomized studies completed to assess the technique or effectiveness of thymectomy in non-thymomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> is frequent [44 ,47-55 ] ; 
fortunately , a large , international multicenter trial is currently enrolling subjects to assess the benefit of thymectomy in non-thymomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis [75 ,76 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> in this syndrome behave in the same manner as sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> . 
an evidence-based review was recently performed to address the role of thymectomy in the management of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , and outcomes of thymectomy in controlled , nonrandomized studies were systematically reviewed [77 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> have also been descrin the radiation field on genitalia [20] . 
initially , it contributes to the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and subsequently <START:PHENOTYPE> steatosis <END> . 
although patients undergoing thymectomy in non-thymomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis were more likely to achieve medication-free remission , become asymptomatic , or exhibit clinical improvement , the association between thymectomy and improved outcomes could attribute either to thymectomy or to differences in the study populations . 
therefore , in non-thymomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , thymectomy should be considered as an option to increase the probability of remission or improvement [77 ] . 
at some locations , however , there was <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dysplasia <END> or disorganization of photoreceptor position . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dysplasia <END> is characterized by palisading outer retinal cells that surround a central lumen . 
it is possible that haploinsufficiency of bmp4 in the retinal pigment epithelium may be responsible for focal <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dysplasia <END> and displacement of photoreceptor nuclei . 
the application of aconitine to the right atrial appendage resulting in the generation of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> and its ligation resulting in restoration of sinus rhythm was amongst the earliest experimental models for this <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> . 
degeneration of rapid atrial <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> into <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> or onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> following multiple atrial ectopic beats offers evidence for this hypothesis . 
ablation of focal <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> since the early part of this century , the role of focal sources of automaticity in sustaining <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> was deemed significant . 
haissaguerre et al . reported successful ablation of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> using a 7- f specially designed 14-polar catheter with interelectrode distance of 3 mm to create linear lesions in the right atrium using radiofrequency energy [25] . 
other signs involving the kidneys ( 5% ) may be : <START:PHENOTYPE> horseshoe kidney <END> , l-shaped kidney , <START:PHENOTYPE> unilateral renal agenesis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> renal cysts <END> , or duplication of the renal pelvis and ureter . 
excessive fluid volume shifts during the procedure may result in <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> or fluid overload and <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> . 
males may exhibit <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism <END> ( 5 10% ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> cryptorchidism <END> , female pubic escutcheon , or <START:PHENOTYPE> gynecomastia <END> . 
plasma exchange trials in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis are summarized in a cochrane review [64 ] . 
those who developed <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> took a longer time to recover from the <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> , whilst the others recovered within 24 48 h . 
one patient had muscarinic features but no <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> , and three of ten patients had fasciculations without any muscarinic signs at the time of diagnosis of intermediate syndrome . 
in addition , the data are useful for the improvement of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> diagnosis , with special regard to cases when the virus replication results only in the mild or inapparent clinical symptoms . 
the comparative analysis , performed on a large number of pigs under harmonised experimental conditions , is providing further data and demonstration material on the pathogenesis of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> . 
although there have been no controlled clinical trials of plasma exchange in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , several series demonstrate significantly improved strength in most patients with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis undergoing plasma exchange [61-63 ] . 
other research groups reported on comparative in vivo analysis of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus strains [8 ,9 ,13 ] but none of the previous investigations provided such a comprehensive analysis of various virulence variants as the present study . 
although many patients have large antecubital veins that may be accessed serially for plasma exchange procedures , some patients require placement of large bore dual lumen central venous catheters . plasma exchange is generally reserved for short-term treatment to achieve rapid strength improvement in myasthenic exacerbations or crises , to prepare patients for thymectomy or another surgical procedure , to prevent steroid-related <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis exacerbations in susceptible patients beginning corticosteroid treatment , and for rare patients refractory to all other treatments . 
in one dog ( the dog with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminaemia <END> ) there was no improvement after treatment with corticosteroids and the dog died three months later . 
plasma exchange plasma exchange is used in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis to achieve rapid , temporary improvement in strength . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and the metabolic syndrome lead to defective insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis , mostly in visceral fat , while <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperinsulinemia <END> results in increased hepatic synthesis of free fatty acids and decreased synthesis of apolipoprotein b-10 0 . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac fibroma <END> is discrete , well-circumscrin the radiation field , not encapsulated , firm , gray-whin the radiation field 3 to 4 cm in diameter , and may , upon occasion , exhibit central calcification [4 ] . 
thus , <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> results in both <START:PHENOTYPE> increased adipose tissue <END> lipolysis and increased hepatic lipogenesis leading to lipid accumulation in the hepatocytes , mainly in the form of triglycerides [16 ] . 
the syndrome is present in 3 5 % of all patients with a <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac fibroma <END> [5 ,69 ] . 
the febrile reactions were very marked in group i , since high <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> was recorded already at post infection day 1 and it lasted throughout the experiment . 
cardiovascular system <START:PHENOTYPE> fibroma <END> of the heart has been descrin the radiation field [5 ,21,46 ,69-74 ] . 
the clinical signs , which are important for the early detection of the new cases of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> infections in the field and for early warning [4 ] varied remarkably in the three groups . 
the ocular phenotypes of bmp4 mutant mice show that bmp4 is a strong candidate to contribute to axenfeld-rieger anomaly and other developmental conditions associated with human <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> . 
there was no association when comparing different <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> results and the results of treatment . 
reactive oxygen species promote progression from <START:PHENOTYPE> steatosis <END> to steatohepatitis and fibrosis by three main mechanisms : lipid peroxidation , cytokine induction , and fas ligand induction [ 19 21] . 
the genes encoding these factors are excellent candidates to modify the phenotypes described here and to cause developmental conditions that associate with <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> . 
the course is variable , and most patients with initial ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> develop bulbar or <START:PHENOTYPE> limb weakness <END> within three years of initial symptom onset . 
ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> with asymmetric <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> and binocular <START:PHENOTYPE> diplopia <END> is the most typical initial presentation , while early or isolated oropharyngeal or <START:PHENOTYPE> limb weakness <END> is less common . 
the hypothesis that pulmonary veins and especially the pulmonary vein-left atrial junction as a focal source of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> is supported by anatomical and pathology studies . 
the most frequent motor cranial nerve deficits were <START:PHENOTYPE> facial muscle weakness <END> ( n = 10 ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> ( n = 10 ) . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis presents with painless , fluctuating , fatigable <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> involving specific muscle groups . 
of the ten intermediate syndrome patients , two had both muscarinic features and <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> at the time of diagnosis of intermediate syndrome . 
in patients with fatigable <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> , the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is supported by : 1 . 
in addition , external <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoparesis <END> was observed in one , and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> in another . 
in one series , <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> nausea <END> were reported in 27% patients , though only 6% patients discontinued mycophenolate mofetil due to these side effects [59 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis results from antibody-mediated , t cell-dependent immunologic attack on the endplate region of the postsynaptic membrane . 
the onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> varied from 15 h to 6 d . 
a small randomized , controlled trial of intravenous immunoglobulin 1.2 and 2.0 gm/kg compared with plasma exchange in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients with exacerbation or crisis showed comparable efficacy between the plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin treatment groups [65 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> of rbc acetylcholinee to <5 0 % of the lower limit of the normal range and/or toxicologically significant concentrations of organophosphate was detected in 69 of 78 . 
these include <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> (70% ) , exophthalmus , rotatory <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , internal <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> orbital cysts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma of the iris <END> , choroid , and optic nerve , <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> chalazions <END> [5 ,11 ,21,63 ] . 
nearly all of these disorders involve a loss of immunological self-tolerance , though transitory neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is a self-limited disorder that follows passive transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus . 
ocular system nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome patients may have various ocular problems that occur with a frequency higher than that in the normal population (20% ) . 
one additional patient developed typical clinical features and characteristic electrophysiological features of intermediate syndrome 15 h after the ingestion during the cholinergic crisis ( increased secretions , pin point pupils , <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> fasciculations <END> ) despite atropine therapy . 
it is a known fact that the moderate or the low virulence variants of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus frequently cause very mild and/or unapparent clinical symptoms , which are accompanied by a restricted in vivo viral replication and invasion [13 ,14 ] . 
intravenous immunoglobulin intravenous immunoglobulin has been utilized in a number of autoimmune neuromuscular disorders including acute and chronic inflammatory <START:PHENOTYPE> polyneuropathy <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is termed ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis when <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> is exclusive to the eyelids and extraocular muscles , and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis when <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> extends beyond these ocular muscles . 
marked <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of neck flexion and proximal limb muscles ( mrc grade 3 or less ) was the most consistent feature in all ten patients . 
seropositive ( seropositive ) <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis defines disease with circulating antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor ( acetylcholine receptor) , while seronegative ( seronegative ) patients lack these antibodies . 
22 with <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> and 17 without <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial arrhythmias <END> with intent to provide a detailed anatomy of the extensions of left atrial myocardium onto the pulmonary veins [30] . 
late onset ( >24 h ) <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> requiring supported ventilation developed in five of the ten intermediate syndrome patients . 
in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , intravenous immunoglobulin may provide short-term improvement in strength for <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis exacerbations and crises , for surgical preparation in patients who are poor plasma exchange candidates because of vascular access issues , and in patients with septicemia . 
recently , antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase ( muscle-specific tyrosine kinase ) have been demonstrated in over 40% of patients with generalized , seronegative <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis [1-5 ] . 
a number of studies demonstrate efficacy for intravenous immunoglobulin in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
definition and diagnostic criteria <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis remains one of the most challenging medical diagnoses due to its fluctuating character and to the similarity of its symptoms to those of other disorders . 
nervous symptoms also appeared with great variations : group i developed serious signs of the involvement of nervous system , while the other two groups remained symptomless , except for three pigs in group ii , which developed slight <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> one day before death . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> sepsis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> are contraindications to plasma exchange . 
some cases of ovarian <START:PHENOTYPE> fibrosarcoma <END> [64 ] and primary ovarian <START:PHENOTYPE> leiomyosarcoma <END> [65 ] have been reported . 
discussion during five years , 33 nova scotia duck tolling retrievers with a disease complex with prolonged stiffness and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint pain <END> from different legs were examined at the university animal hospital in uppsala . 
improved strength is generally observed after the second or third exchange procedure in most <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> is currently regarded as a systemic , low-grade inflammation , in which adipose tissue and its hormones have a central role [13 ] . 
genito-urinary system <START:PHENOTYPE> ovarian cysts <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> fibromas <END> are present in 25 5 0 % of affected women [5 ] and are often bilateral ( 75% ) . 
concerning epidemiology and early diagnosis of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , group ii is the most interesting in our present studies . 
the author asked the assembled group if they had ever had one or more of these transient cysts [4] , and this exercin the radiation fieldwas repeated for the american support group for nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome [4 ] . 
the majority of the dogs displayed <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> reactivity and the symptoms usually decreased with corticosteroid treatment . 
the clinical signs , the <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> reactivity and the response to corticosteroids strongly suggest that the disorder described in this study in the tolling retriever breed is immune-mediated and the findings may indicate a chronic systemic rheumatic disorder [6 ,14 ,25] . 
stiffness , mainly after rest , and chronic pain from several joints of extremities , in some cases accompanied with <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle pain <END> , were the most common findings . 
in order to describe this disease in tolling retrievers further and to exclude other chronic diseases , haematology , serum biochemistry and serology tests , urine analysis , radiographic examinations and <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibody <END> ) tests were performed . 
nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis : pathophysiology the primary insult in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis is accumulation of triglycerides in the liver , as a result of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> [7 ] . 
cytokines and nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease experimental models 2.1 . 
in the current review , we explore the role of cytokines in the clinical setting of nonalcoholic <START:PHENOTYPE> fatty liver <END> disease , in terms of pathogenesis , their use as markers of disease progression and their perspective as therapeutic targets . 
differential diagnosis includes congenital myasthenic syndromes , lambert eaton syndrome , botulism , organophosphate intoxication , mitochondrial disorders involving <START:PHENOTYPE> progressive external ophthalmoplegia <END> , acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy ( acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy) , motor neuron disease , and brainstem ischemia . 
disease name <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis included diseases autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis ( <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis ) encompasses all of the immunologically-mediated disorders affecting the endplate region of the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction . 
the longest myocardial sleeves in the superior pulmonary veins in this study correlated with the observation reported by haissaguerre et al . that the commonest source of the ectopic beats triggering <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> were in these veins [12 ] . 
the most notable of monoamine oxidase polymorphism was a nonsense mutation that led to a complete loss of monoamine oxidase function in males showing extreme forms of impulsive behavior and <START:PHENOTYPE> aggression <END> . 
because of its metabolic role , drugs which interfere with monoamine oxidase such as clorgyline have been used to treat attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> ) were detected by use of the indirect immunofluorescnce ( indirect immunofluorescnce ) technique using hep-2 cells fixed in alcohol as antigen substrate [8 ] . 
the sera were screened for <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> reactivity at a 1:2 0 dilution in pbs and the reaction visualised by a fitc conjugated fc- specific goat anti-dog igg ( cappel research products , durham , nc ) at dilution 1:60 . 
survivin mrna has been detected in various human malignant neoplasms , such as gastric cancer , <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , lung cancer , <START:PHENOTYPE> colorectal cancer <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> pancreatic cancer <END> , urinary bladder cancer , soft tissue <START:PHENOTYPE> sarcoma <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> neuroblastoma <END> and osteo <START:PHENOTYPE> sarcoma <END> . 
in the clinic , the expression of major histocompatibility complex class ii on <START:PHENOTYPE> colorectal carcinomas <END> is correlated with more favourable prognosis . 
the metabolic syndrome is a common disorder consisting of a cluster of abnormalities including <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , dyslipidemia , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercoagulability <END> and is associated with increased risk for cancer , alzheimer 's disease , type-ii diabetes and <START:PHENOTYPE> atherosclerosis <END> [4 ] . 
clinical signs such as coughing and <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> were also recorded daily . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> epidemic of the rapidly growing aging population makes understanding underlying relationship between adiposity , chronic inflammation and the metabolic syndrome essential . 
material and methods patients and tissue samples twenty-two tissue specimens , all obtained from <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> patients at the department of orthopaedic surgery , nihon university school of medicine , during the period from 1992 to 2000 , were embedded in paraffin . 
increased inflammatory peptides are being studied as possible modifiable markers of the increased risk predictors of disease and possibly the underlying link between <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and the poor clinical outcomes seen with the metabolic syndrome . 
in this study , we measured survivin expression levels in paraffin-embedded <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> tissues , and concluded that high survivin mrna expression levels may serve as a prognostic factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> patients . 
the fact that many of these peptides are derived from adipose tissue leads us to the question of whether adipose tissue itself is the underlying pathophysiological link between <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and the poor clinical outcomes associated with the metabolic syndrome . 
the valine allele was shown to be preferentially transmitted to attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder probands and was associated with impulsive false alarm errors on a continuous performance task . 
several studies on <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive compulsive disorder <END> have found associations with catecholamine-o-methyl transferase . 
risks of multiple pregnancy the offspring of multiple pregnancies are at greater risk for adverse perinatal outcomes compared to their singleton counterparts , predominantly due to increased risks for <START:PHENOTYPE> preterm delivery <END> and due to monochorionicity [3 ] . 
the pump twin is at risk for <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> due to the increased demands on its heart . 
the group comprising symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> consisted of dogs that all were in the acute phase of detaching several claws , while the the black hair follicular dysplasia group were dogs that presented typical clinical signs of this disease , and in most instances had done so for a long while . 
when the springer spaniels , standard poodles and the akitas in the study were compared , the springer spaniel showed significantly more severe clinical signs compared to the standard poodle with respect to <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> , seborrhoea , <START:PHENOTYPE> pyoderma <END> and the overall severity of clinical signs . 
two dogs showed both symmetrical lupoid onychodystophy and black hair follicular dysplasia , while 1 dog with symmmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and 1 dog with black hair follicular dysplasia in addition had muscular pain that could not be attributed to trauma . 
patients were excluded from the study if the pregnancy was complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome , monoamnionicity , <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth restriction <END> , growth discordance , structural anomalies , or twin reversed arterial perfusion sequence . 
it is becoming clear that this <START:PHENOTYPE> increased adipose tissue <END> is not simply a reservoir for excess nutrients , but rather an active and dynamic organ capable of expressing several cytokines and other fat-derived peptides ( fat-derived peptides ) . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> /abdominal obesity , and risks for many age-related diseases characterize this common syndrome . 
conclusion : we concluded that high levels of survivin mrna expression suggest poor prognosis for <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> patients . 
it was therefore deemed necessary to scrutinise cases diagnosed with for example seborrhoea , <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia <END> and immune-related skin diseases . 
patients in whom the angle recession extends for 240 to 360 degrees of the angle circumference ( 67 to 100% ) frequently develop elevated intraocular pressure and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> whereas patients with less extensive damage typically do not have high intraocular pressure , although their risk of progressing to <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> is increased . 
results : expression of survivin mrna was detected in all <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> samples . 
these have long been the only useful prognostic factors for <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> patients . 
this increased body fat is characterized by increased visceral adiposity [1 ] and occurs despite the <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased subcutaneous fat <END> and progressive sarcopenia typical of aging [2 ] . 
introduction <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> is associated with high morbidity rates in young adults and adolescents . 
current treatment protocols for <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> include wide surgical resection of the primary lesion and multidrug chemotherapy [4 , 19 ] . 
we suggest that high levels of inflammatory peptides are markers for <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> /abdominal obesity seen with aging , but some may not necessarily have a causative role in the development of inflammation . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibody <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> ) test is currently considered the most specific and sensitive serologic test for <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> [10 ,13 ] . 
that the claw disease in a swedish gordon setter seemed to be of lupoid character , and our suspicion that black hair follicular dysplasia and symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> in the gordon setter might somehow be connected , were the incitaments for investigating the occurence of <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> in gordon setters with symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and black hair follicular dysplasia , respectively . 
the aim of this study was to investigate whether these dogs had signs of systemic <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmunity <END> . 
materials and methods animals the animals studied comprised 21 healthy gordon setters ( controls ) and 21 gordon setters with symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and/or black hair follicular dysplasia , respectively . 
msto-211h , mesothelioma , cell line also showed a weak induction of major histocompatibility complex class ii in response to ifn-gamma and hepg2 , <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> , was completely non-inducible (data not shown ) . 
incubation with as little as 102 iu/ml ifn-gamma induced a 10-fold increase of major histocompatibility complex class ii-specific fluorescence in sw480 <START:PHENOTYPE> colon carcinoma <END> cell line . 
other groups of functionally related genes are shown in figure 7 : some are ion channels ( figure 7d , whereas others are associated with keratinocytes ( figure 7c ) or involved in the respiratory chain ( figure 7e ) . a wide diversity of adhesion molecules was also identified ( figure 7h ) . these included the obvious - <START:PHENOTYPE> melanoma <END> cell adhesion molecule ( <START:PHENOTYPE> melanoma <END> cell adhesion molecule ) - but also atp1b2 ( atpase , na+/k + transporting , beta 2 polypeptide , which is believed to function in neuron-astrocyte adhesion ) , thrombospondin ( thrombospondin , an adhesion molecule involved in blood clotting) , osteopontin ( osteopontin , which promotes osteoclast adhesion ) and osteoblast-specific factor 2 ( osteoblast-specific factor 2 , a human homolog of the insect protein fasciclin thought to have a role in bone adhesion ) . finally , as shown in figure 7i , madh2 and mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 and 5 ( mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 2 and 5 ) shared with transforming growth factor beta 3 ( transforming growth factor beta 3 ) terms such as 'tgf-beta ' , transforming ' and 'factor beta ' , reflecting the involvement of madh in the signaling pathway of tgf-beta family members . ] and see additional data files ) . 
the abnormalities affect a variety of anterior segment tissues including the drainage structures of the iridocorneal angle and are similar to those reported in human patients with anterior segment dysgenesis and <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> . 
here , we report that the presence of phorbol myristate acetate in tissue culture restores ifn-gamma-dependent major histocompatibility complex class ii expression in the poorly-responding ls1034 <START:PHENOTYPE> colon carcinoma <END> cell line but fails to produce this effect in two other ifn-gamma-resistant cell lines , msto-211h mesothelioma and hepg2 <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> . 
its expression and circulating levels correlate directly with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> will lower circulating levels . 
interestingly , another <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disease <END> ankylosing spondylitis ( mim 106300) , also maps to chromosome 16q , however , it appears to map telomeric to the blau syndrome interval . 
infusion of il6 results in <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlipidemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperglycemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> in experimental models . 
of the several putative susceptibility loci for crohn 's diseaseand <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> , the crohn 's locus on 16q between markers d16s409 and d16s419 ( 56 .1 65 .6 cm from p-terminus )and the psoriasis locus on 16q near d16s3110overlap with the locus for the blau syndrome . 
[14 ]il-6 plays a role in the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> and may directly cause induction of c-reactive protein . 
affected individuals typically display one or more of the following granulomatous inflammations that have variable age-at-onset : acute anterior <START:PHENOTYPE> uveitis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> arthritis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> skin rash <END> . 
the phenotype of the blau syndrome resembles another multisystem granulomatous disorder , crohn 's disease ( mim 266600) , and another <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> psoriasis <END> ( mim 177900 ) . 
to further understand why wet belly develops , we also examined whether the occurrence of wet belly correlates with changes in blood constituents associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> malnutrition <END> or other stress . 
other inflammatory cytokines such as il-1 , il-8 , il18 , serum amyloid a , have been shown to be increased with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and may have a yet undetermined role in the syndrome . 
afterwards they appear with a <START:PHENOTYPE> thin hair <END> coat composed either of thin wooly hairs that are easily removed ( fig . 2) , or by short stiff hairs ( fig . 3 ) . 
considering the varying clinical manifestations and the observed diagnostic problems , further research has to be conducted on comparative pathology of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus , with special regard to the emerging new viral variants of very mild pathogenicity , causing very weak or completely unapparent clinical symptoms , which can easily be overlooked in the field . 
after 32 weeks ' gestation , the prospective risk of unexpected antepartum <START:PHENOTYPE> stillbirth <END> was 1/23. 
discussion although classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> is registered as one of the most important transboundary animal diseases ( transboundary animal diseases) , notifiable to oie , the regular re-occurrence of the outbreaks in various regions of the world indicates that many questions are still poorly answered concerning the biology of this devastating disease . 
in the present paper we discuss the possible role that <START:PHENOTYPE> malnutrition <END> and specific diets may have had in inducing wet belly . 
one of the problems is that classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> has an increasing tendency to appear and re-appear in a clinically very mild or in a completely unapparent form . 
the dogs have been treated with antibiotics , glucocorticoids , zinc and fatty acid supplementation , and the response has been recorded from poor to good : some dogs are put to death because of chronic pain , but most dogs go on living in a state of chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> where every claw is misshapen , with stunted friable structures ( fig . 1 ) . 
these findings are in accordance with symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> [13 ] . 
about half of the 2521 patients enrolled had an underlying diagnosis of non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> . 
histopathological studies of this phenomenon have not been conducted in norway , but j nsson ( unpubl . 1996 ) found vacuolar alteration and degeneration of epidermal basal cells , and acute and chronic inflammation and pigmentary <START:PHENOTYPE> incontinence <END> in the dermis of the toes of an affected swedish gordon setter . 
literature profiles were generated for a second large dataset consisting of the 200 genes and expressed sequence tags found to be the most differentially regulated in classic versus desmoplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastomas <END> in a study of central nervous system tumors . 
the conclusion is that implantable cardioverter defibrillators implantation saves lives ( but amiodarone doesn 't ) in patients with class 2 or 3 <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> , irrespective of the etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> . 
it has been also demonstrated that the increased major histocompatibility complex class ii expression on tumor cells and macrophages following treatment with ifn-gamma in vivo was associated with enhanced efficacy of adoptive t cell therapy in a mouse model of metastatic <START:PHENOTYPE> sarcoma <END> . 
it is interesting to note that in patients with class iii <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> , irrespective of etiology , implantable cardioverter defibrillators implantation was associated with a significant survival advantage when compared to amiodarone but not when compared to placebo . 
indeed , a rapid search of the online mendelian inheritance in man database ( online mendelian inheritance in man database ) for genes associated with the terms 'severe ' and ' disorder ' confirmed that mutations of galc , lamb3 , gjb2 , jag1 , tgfbi , lipoprotein lipase and low-density lipoprotein receptor were the origin of serious disorders : krabbe disease , herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa , <START:PHENOTYPE> autosomal dominant deafness <END> - vohwinkel syndrome , <START:PHENOTYPE> alagille syndrome <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> corneal dystrophy <END> , type i <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlipoproteinemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypercholesterolemia <END> , respectively . 
as a result of this large randomized , double-blind trial incorporating a placebo arm , prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillators implantation in non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> patients with a lvef < 36 % and nyha functional class ii or iii seems justified and risk stratification in this group of patients may no longer be required . 
in addition , two genes sharing a similar vocabulary could be found outside the region outlined in figure 6e : gcdh ( linked to <START:PHENOTYPE> glutaric acidemia <END> type i ) and mpi ( linked to carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome , type ib ) . 
tnf , previously known as lymphotoxin and cachetin , is believed to be involved in the wasting that occurs during acute and chronic illness and <START:PHENOTYPE> malignancy <END> . 
the histological type of <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> was osteoblastic in 14 patients , chondroblastic in four patients and fibroblastic in four patients . 
this fact is reflected in the analysis of literature profiles , as groups of genes could be found to be associated with brain tissues ( figure 7f , for example , hpca ( hippocalcin) , syp ( synaptophysin) , grik1 ( glutamate receptor , ionotropic , kainate 1 ) , a4 precursor-like protein ( amyloid beta a4 precursor-like protein) ) , immune cells ( figure 7b , for example , cd40 , il15ra ( il-15 receptor , alpha chain) , lilb4 ( leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor 4) ) or tumor cells ( figure 7a , for example , mybl1 ( v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene) , abl2 ( v-abl abelson murine <START:PHENOTYPE> leukemia <END> viral oncogene homolog 2) ) . 
on this background , the abnormalities were typically limited to the anterior segment ( involving enlarged pupils and <START:PHENOTYPE> buphthalmos <END> ) . 
[10 ] thus , tnf is not only a classical cytokine but may be causal in the <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> of the metabolic syndrome of aging . 
in-vitro studies have demonstrated that tnf decreases the insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation , and down regulates several steps in the insulin signaling pathway [6-9 ] while neutralizing agents for tnf have been shown to improve <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> . 
it enrolled patients with ef < 36 % and nyha class ii or iii <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> [27] into three arms , medical therapy vs . medical therapy plus amiodarone vs . medical therapy plus implantable cardioverter defibrillators . 
in the basal state tnf is directly proportional to fat mass and has been shown to be involved in the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> [5 ] . 
leptin serves as a marker of energy sufficiency by rapidly decreasing during starvation and <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> . 
[11 ] with <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , leptin levels are increased in proportion to fat mass , but its activity to decrease appetite seems reduced . 
cell culture a human <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> cell line ( nos-1 ) was obtained from the riken gene bank , bioresources center . 
the presence of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus nucleic acid was demonstrated by a pilot in situ hybridisation in various organs in all the three experiments . 
there were no significant differences between the intrauterine fetal demise-affected pregnancies and the unaffected pregnancies with regards to antenatal indicators of <START:PHENOTYPE> intrauterine growth restriction <END> and twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome . 
( one case presented with <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased fetal movement <END> . ) 
as a result , the authors suggested that after 32 weeks ' gestation , the prospective risk for fetal death in these pregnancies might be eliminated by elective <START:PHENOTYPE> preterm delivery <END> . 
two dogs showed both symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and black hair follicular dysplasia , and one of these was <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positive . 
at that gestational age , many of the risks associated with prematurity , such as intraventricular hemorrhage , necrotizing <START:PHENOTYPE> enterocolitis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory distress <END> syndrome , have abated . 
the results suggest that symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and black hair follicular dysplasia in the gordon setter might be <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune diseases <END> that are pathogenetically related , which might indicate a common genetic predisposition . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> ) were demonstrated in 3 out of 10 gordon setters with symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and in 5 out of 13 gordon setters with black hair follicular dysplasia . 
although suggestive , the data are insufficient to prove efficacy in patients in <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [18 ] . 
more data on effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy on mortality in <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> is still awaited . 
cardiac resynchronization also reduces <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> hospitalization and shows a trend toward reducing all-cause mortality . 
this finding suggests that cardiac resynchronization may have a substantial impact on the most common mechanism of death among patients with advanced <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> . 
the 2002 task force of the acc/aha/naspe gave a class iia recommendation ( weight of evidence in favor of efficacy ) to biventricular pacing in medically refractory , symptomatic new york heart association class iii or iv patients with idiopathic dilated or ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> , prolonged qrs interval ( 130 ms ) , left ventricular end-diastolic diameter greater than or equal to 55 mm and ejection fraction less than or equal to 30 percent . 
we found that 3 out of 10 with black hair follicular dysplasia were <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positive , while including 2 dogs with symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and 1 with <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle pain <END> in addition to black hair follicular dysplasia , 5 out of 13 were <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positive . 
nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome cases and each class of tumor analyzed revealed a different distribution of the mutations in the various ptch1 domains [110 ] . 
a slight overrepresentation of male dogs was also found in a greater material of norwegian gordon setters with symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> ( trotland , r . pers . com . 1998 ) where the female/male distribution was 23/33 . 
as a result of the miracle trial , the fda has approved biventricular pacing as a treatment for moderate to severe <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> . 
it was found that cardiac resynchronization reduces mortality from progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> in patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction . 
in black and red doberman pinschers <START:PHENOTYPE> hair loss <END> develops between 1 and 4 years of age , as in the gordon setter , and <START:PHENOTYPE> hair loss <END> is dorsally distributed on the lower back . 
in the lung , as the larvae mature and move up the bronchi , the parasite induces alveolitis , followed by <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchiolitis <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchitis <END> . 
the sod1 findings in this study are similar to the observation made on the human <START:PHENOTYPE> samyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> . 
pedigrees with multiple features of nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome were most lin the radiation fieldy to test positin the radiation fieldfor ptch1 mutations [133 ] . 
in humans , decreased activities of the sod1 enzyme were reported in <START:PHENOTYPE> famyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> patients [39 ] . 
a recent study has reported that certain haplotypes of ptch1 polymorphisms may mediate the susceptibility to <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> [132 ] . 
although there were no significant changes in vitamin a levels in the horses enrolled in the study , three horses developed retinal <START:PHENOTYPE> pigmentation <END> . 
pedigrees with multiple or early-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> without other features of the din the radiation fieldse did not test positin the radiation fieldfor ptch1 mutations [133 ] . 
the low ph in many colic horses during anaesthesia was due to a <START:PHENOTYPE> mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis <END> . 
during anaesthesia many colic horses experienced periods of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> , and acid-base and blood-gas disturbances . 
no ptch2 mutations were found in 11 simplex cases of nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome or in 11 individuals with famost striking are small very transient keratin-filled cystsl cases of nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome who did not have in the radiation fieldtifiable ptch1 mutations . 
the increased heart rate in colic horses may be explained by pain and endotoxemia but also by <START:PHENOTYPE> hypovolemia <END> in some cases [29] . 
in many cases , <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> arising from perturbations of ptch1 function leads to a concomitant up-regulation of the highly similar gene ptch2 . 
mutations have been found in one simplex case ( in the radiation field , a single occurrence of the din the radiation fieldse in a family ) of <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> and one simplex case of bcc [134 ] . 
the patient group as a whole is , however , significantly associated with positive <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> compared to the controls . 
discussion the fact that the claw disease in the gordon setter might be of lupoid character was the incitament for investigating <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> , anti extractable nuclear antigens , anti dna and anti dnp in serum from such dogs . 
seven of the diseased dogs were <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positive and 2 had antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens , both detected by the elisa method . 
2 ) rna extraction from nos-1 total rna was extracted from the <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> cell line nos-1 with trizol reagent ( gibco bal ) by the acid-guanidium-phenol chloroform method . 
when including dogs with other signs in addition to symmetrcal lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> , 3 out of 10 displayed <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positivity . 
our suspicion that black hair follicular dysplasia and symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> in the gordon setter might somehow be connected , was the incitament for investigating the same parameters in serum from these dogs . 
[13 ] found that 2 out of 12 dogs with symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> were <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> positive . 
the madit ii trial showed a significant survival benefit from implantable cardioverter defibrillator placement in patients who have had a previous <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> and have an left ventricularef 30 percent [69 ] . 
this finding is consistent with reports on human <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> , where the studies found no significant differences in the plasma levels of vitamin a , -carotenes , and glutathione peroxidase [30,47 ,48 ] . 
in support for this , increased blood levels of haptoglobin , serum amyloid a and fibrinogen were detected during viral and/or bacterial <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory infections <END> in calves ( e.g . [7 , 11] ) . 
such findings have led to exploring its potential in the therapy of <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> . 
there has been a long-term interest in vitamin e because of its role in the integrity of membranes and its association with deficiency syndromes that included encephalomalacia and <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> in man and animals [20,39 ,43 ] . 
in spite of the discrepancy in reporting the plasma and csf levels of vitamin e in <START:PHENOTYPE> samyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> patients , there is a consensus that there is increased lipid peroxidation in the disease [30,40-42 ] . 
because the clinical signs are typified by <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> and muscle loss , it is more likely that the patients would react to the symptoms by changing their dietary intake which is likely to include supplementation of minerals and vitamins , including vitamin e . 
it is estimated that the average duration between onset and diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> is 12 month [38 ] . 
diagnostic methods diagnosis of nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome can be made in the presence of two major crin the radiation fieldia or one major and two minor crin the radiation fieldia [6 ] : major crin the radiation fieldia 1 . 
a progressive remodeling of myocardial collagen matrix well documented in familial <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathies <END> may impair intraventricular conduction . 
this horse developed a post anaesthetic triceps <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> . 
in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> not due to <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> , ventricular asynergy may be associated with interventricular or intra-ventricular conduction delays . 
this would suggest that more than <START:PHENOTYPE> vitamin e deficiency <END> is in play . 
the mechanisms of slow myocardial conduction associated with asynergic contraction in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> vary with the underlying pathology et al [5 ,62 ,63 ] . 
the results of this study showed that the functional capacity improved significantly during cardiac resynchronization therapy in <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> and non-coronary artery disease patients . left ventricularef and new york heart association class in non-coronary artery disease patience showed a significantly greater improvement . 
b and c show the histopathological features with lichenoid infiltration of mononuclear cells at the dermo/epidermal junction , hydropic degeneration and apoptosis of keratinocytes in the basal layer and marked pigmentary <START:PHENOTYPE> incontinence <END> . 
at necropsy , lesions were found in different organs , but it was particularly striking to observe large areas of <START:PHENOTYPE> pallor <END> in the myocardium . 
3 presents the flank of another gordon setter that had both black hair follicular dysplasia and symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> (a ) . 
the inflammatory reaction was especially severe in the heart , where large areas of the myocardium appeared infiltrated with huge numbers of mononuclear immune cells , causing cardiac <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> and degeneration . 
a dog presented with cutaneous nodules , enlarged lymph nodes and <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> in limbs , face and abdomen . 
results figure 1 presents the picture of a typical paw of a gordon setter with chronic symmetrical <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> showing small and stunted claws (a ) . 
the success of our efforts in reproducing this disease in a natural model offers a unique opportunity with great implications to human health in general and <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> in particular . 
in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> , beside ventricular remodeling , ventricular asynergy may be associated with segmental wall- motion abnormalities as result of <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> scars , or of ischemic non-contractile segments . 
survivin mrna expression was detected in all <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> samples but none of the normal tissues . 
results reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the expressions of survivin mrna in normal tissues , the <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> cell line nos-1 , and clinical samples from <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> patients . 
recommendations biventricular pacing is an effective approach to the therapy of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> and interventricular conduction delay and studies suggest that biventricular pacing can improve exercise tolerance and new york heart association functional class in such patients in sinus rhythm . 
initial data regarding " upgrading " from right ventricular to biventricular pacing using an left ventricular lead to achieve cardiac resynchronization in <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> patients with chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> who have undergone radiofrequency atrio-ventricular nodal ablation followed by standard right ventricular pacing is promising [24] . 
survivin mrna was detectable in all <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> samples , and levels of survivin mrna were 0.83 0.25 in initial biopsy samples ( fig . 2 ) . 
although significant benefits were observed in both groups after cardiac resynchronization therapy , <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> scars limit the mechanical benefits of qrs narrowing and resynchronization . 
cardiac resynchronization therapy can only recruit and coordinate a fraction of the myocardial mass to increase ventricular mechanical work in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> . 
pacing in <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> paroxysmal or persistent <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> occurs in up to 30 percent of patients with hf [65 ] . 
hence the benefits of cardiac resynchronization therapy should not be denied to patients with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> on the basis of underlying cardiac pathology including patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> and wide qrs et al [64 ] . 
haematological abnormalities included normochromic <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> ( haematocrit value of 32 .9 per cent ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> lymphopenia <END> /monocytopenia ( 0.6 109/l) , <START:PHENOTYPE> thrombocytopenia <END> (54 109/l ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoalbuminemia <END> ( 2 .1 0 g/dl ) . 
on initial evaluation , abnormal physical examination findings included non-ulcerated cutaneous nodules , a generalized mild lymphadenomegaly of the superficial lymph nodes , a stiff gait and <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> in limbs , face and abdomen . 
monoamine oxidase male knockout mice also show high levels of <START:PHENOTYPE> aggression <END> . 
more recently , the association with <START:PHENOTYPE> aggression <END> was replicated in a study showing that maltreated children with certain alleles of monoamine oxidase were more likely to show <START:PHENOTYPE> aggressive behaviors <END> . 
less severe genetic variants are known to exist in monoamine oxidase which have been studied as candidates to explain various dimensions of <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric illness <END> . 
this is also known as <START:PHENOTYPE> stillbirth <END> . 
monoamine oxidase associations with attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder , bipolar disorderpanic disorderand alcoholism have been reported . 
unlike other spontaneous animal models , equine motor neuron disease has many clinical , pathological , and epidemiological features of <START:PHENOTYPE> samyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> . 
as a spontaneous , sporadic , and progressive degenerative disorder of bulbospinal motor neurons , equine motor neuron disease bears close resemblance to <START:PHENOTYPE> samyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> [4 ] . 
a meta-analysis was done by bradley et al [66 ] of the available studies to determine the effect of cardiac resynchronization therapy on mortality in <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> . 
conclusion we believe that equine motor neuron disease , just as <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> , may have a multifactorial etiology and that oxidative stress is a major contributing/predisposing factor , i.e. , sufficient cause , in motor neuron death but not necessarily the sole etiologic agent/factor . 
nevertheless , as a spontaneous animal model equine motor neuron disease offers the prospect those epidemiologic studies possibly will identify risk factors with bearing on the pathogenesis of <START:PHENOTYPE> samyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> . 
the characteristic response to repetitive nerve stimulation at 2 to 3 hz stimulation rate in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is a progressive decrement in amplitude of the compound muscle action potential , which is most reliably found in weak muscles [42 ] . 
one study , for example , evaluated the utility of adenosine ( given as 6 and 12 mg boluses ) compared to head-up tilt-table testing in 85 patients presenting with <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> and in 14 normal controls [40 ] . 
the inducibility of a vasovagal response with adenosine was comparable to that with the tilt table test in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> ( 26 and 34 percent ) and in normal ( 7 percent for both tests ) . 
a vasovagal response was defined as the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> or presyncope associated with relative <START:PHENOTYPE> bradycardia <END> and/or <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> (decrease in systolic blood pressure 30 mmhg ) occurring 15 to 60 sec after adenosine injection or during the tilt table test . 
the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> in nyha class iv <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> is also high but the competing risk of pump failure makes it the second cause of death in this very sick category of patients . 
the primary site of origin is the lung and occurrence is usually associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased pulmonary function <END> and chylous effusions [8 ] . 
in the merit-hf trial ( nyha <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> class ii-iv , ef < 40% ) , the most common cause of mortality in patients with nyha functional classes ii and iii was sudden cardiac death[8 ] . 
adenosine and nitrates adenosine may have a complementary role to the tilt table test in the evaluation of patients with possible vasovagal <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , since it may increase sympathetic discharge by activation of cardiovascular afferent nerves ; 
however , the cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> and repetitive nerve stimulation findings in this rare condition are not well understood but postulated to be explained by both presynaptic ( e.g. , decreased choline substrate for acetylcholine production , negative feedback , damage to nerve terminal ) and postsynaptic ( e.g. , end-plate damage or persistent partial depolarization , receptor desensitization ) responses to persistently high levels of acetylcholine [47 ] . 
surgical intervention is necessary in complications ( thoracic drainage , pleurectomy for recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumothorax <END> ) . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> ) may well be the first manifestation of non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , and idiopathic non ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy is responsible for 10 % of all <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac deaths <END> in adults [6 ] . 
patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> suffer from <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> mortality and <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> in near equal numbers [5 ] . 
lymphangioleiomyomatosis can occur without evidence of other disease ( sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis ) or in conjunction with tuberous sclerosis complex , an autosomal dominant tumour suppressor gene syndrome characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and tumours in the brain , heart , skin and kidney . 
the majority of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac deaths <END> occur among patients that are classically defined as low risk , including those with nyha functional class ii or i . 
survivors of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> often have recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> as their clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> [7 ] . 
in an international <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> study it was found that 18 % of symptomatic patients with ejection fraction less than 30% were diagnosed with non ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy[3 ] . 
mild to moderate bloodstained subcutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> , unrelated to infestation with warble fly larvae , was noticed in 5 cases ( 18% ) , affecting ventral and/or lateral parts of neck and head ( n = 3) , or area around nostrils and upper lip ( n = 2 ) . 
the age-adjusted mortality in patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ranges from 0.1 0 per 10,000 person-years among men aged 35-39 up to 1 .16 per 10,000 person-years among men aged 55-57 [2 ] . 
three of these cases also had subcutaneous <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> . 
currently , mortality in non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> is 12-13% at 3 years [4 ] . 
independent risk factors for death include smoking , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , and high diastolic blood pressure [2 ] . 
although a controlled infusion of isoproterenol is safe in patients without heart disease , it should not be used in those with <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> since angina and serious <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> can be provoked [37 ,38 ] . 
neurological testing generally , skull films , lumbar puncture , radionuclide brain scan , carotid doppler 's , and cerebral angiography do not yield diagnostic information for a cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> in the absence of clinical findings that are suggestive of a specific neurological process [1 ] . 
in patients with negative passive tests and a high likelihood of neurally mediated <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> clinically ( e.g. , young person with concurrent autonomic symptoms ) , additional testing with isoproterenol is recommended . 
upright tilt testing is recommended for patients with recurrent unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> in whom cardiac causes have been excluded or are not likely . 
one study of 55 patients with a history of neurocardiogenic <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> found that an intravenous infusion of clomipramine ( 5 mg in 5 min ) increased the number of patients with a positive tilt table test (8 0 versus 53 percent without clomipramine ) ; 
one study compared sublingual nitroglycerin to isoproterenol in 71 patients with unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> and 30 controls and found that the diagnostic accuracy was similar ; 
the incidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> is 5 - 8 / 100,000 / year [1 ,2 ] . 
clear criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> malignancy <END> have not been elaborated in this very rare tumour entity until now , owing to their rarity . 
in one report , the use of sublingual isosorbide dinitrate increased the frequency of a positive tilt study among patients with a history of vasovagal <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> from 13 to 87 percent , although the number of normal with a positive tilt study also increased from 0 to 6 percent [42 ] . 
non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> risk stratificationimplantable cardioverter defibrillatorsudden cardiac deathnon-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy ( non ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy ) is a primary disease of the myocardium , characterized by dilatation of all four chambers of the heart , but primarily the left ventricle , with associated systolic dysfunction . 
conclusions our findings suggest that intermediate syndrome is a spectrum disorder in which the initial pathological process starts with acute cholinergic state , which may or may not progress through a series of electrophysiological changes leading to <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> and progressive decrement on repetitive nerve stimulation . 
in this review we try to analyze the existing data of risk stratification of non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and its clinical implications in practice . 
sequential repetitive nerve stimulation need to be carried out to detect the development of the severe decrement pattern , an ominous sign indicating that <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory failure <END> is imminent . 
identification of this subgroup of patients who carry the risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> despite adequate medical management is a challenge .yet another method is a blanket treatment of patients with this disorder with anti arrhythmic medications or anti tachyarrhythmia devices like implantable cardioverter defibrillators ( implantable cardioverter defibrillators ) . 
a proportion of patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> carries a grave prognosis and is prone to <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> from sustained ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> . 
manifestations of this disorder are in many ways similar to its counterpart , ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ) . 
another boy with a missense mutation [20] showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> , corpus callosum <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> severe mental retardation <END> , but also other anomalies such as <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip and palate <END> , brachytelephalangy , and <START:PHENOTYPE> broad thumbs <END> and halluces . 
albeit the varying etiologies of this heart muscle disorder , it presents with symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> , and rarely as <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> ) . 
the first was a boy with down syndrome and typical facial features of trisomy 21 , <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> ( rarer in down syndrome than in mowat-wilson syndrome ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular coloboma <END> affecting iris and retina [28] . 
non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ( non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> ) is a disorder of myocardium . 
facial phenotype was similar to mowat-wilson syndrome but differed by the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> bilateral cleft lip <END> and palate , and eyebrows that were not typical of mowat-wilson syndrome . 
the third missense mutation was found in a young child with typical mowat-wilson syndrome including <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> who died at age of 3 years [22] . 
apparatus and behavioral analysis rats were tested in the apparatus used previously to assess <START:PHENOTYPE> compulsive checking behavior <END> and is described in detail elsewhere . 
the 0.5 mg/kg dose of quinpirole was selected because it is representative of the sensitization effects induced by doses of the drug from 0.25 to 2.5 mg/kg and because it was previously used to induce <START:PHENOTYPE> compulsive checking behavior <END> . 
the first person reported was a 48-year-old woman with severe <START:PHENOTYPE> constipation <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mild mental retardation <END> in the absence of specific facial anomalies , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , and other malformations caused by non-truncating mutations with a 3 bp in frame deletion [27] . 
serum phosphate concentrations may be affected by <START:PHENOTYPE> acidosis <END> , but although most of the colic horses in the present study were acidaemic there were no differences in phosphate between the groups during anaesthesia . 
the disorders that may cause <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> include generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> anxiety <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> panic disorders <END> , major <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , somatization disorder , and alcohol/substance abuse . 
summary and conclusion <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> is a common manifestation of many disease processes . 
patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> and heart disease , particularly when there is <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> , bundle branch block , evidence of <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> , or a positive family history of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> and heart disease , appear to be at high risk for death and require an aggressive initial approach . 
mean psa ( mean psa ) of the first death dropped from 98 to 43 mmhg 5 minutes after oleic acid administration , then <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrest <END> happened . 
studies of eeg in <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> have shown that an epileptiform abnormality was found in 1 % of patients ; 
psychiatric assessment <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric illnesses <END> must be considered as a cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , especially in young patients and those with multiple syncopal episodes who also have other nonspecific symptoms [48 ] . 
the other also died of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> 15 minutes after oleic acid injection . 
head ct scans are rarely useful to assign an etiology , but are needed if subdural bleed due to head injury is suspected or in patients suspected to have <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> as a cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of consciousness <END> [1 ] . 
also the male preponderance of <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> in general populations ( 4 :1 ) [43 ] can cause a bias of ascertainment and explain the male excess in mowat-wilson syndrome [9 ] . 
the manifestation of <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> is not influenced by deletion size [11 ] . 
moreover , zfhx1b knockout mice do not exhibit <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> [44] , therefore a non-allelic modifier might contribute to the manifestation of <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> [11 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> , when present , is a strong cross reference marker , even in the neonatal period , but it is not constant . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 mainly affects pigment production in the eye , resulting in optic changes associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> including <START:PHENOTYPE> hypopigmentation <END> of the retina , <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> foveal hypoplasia <END> , abnormal crossing of the optic fibers and <START:PHENOTYPE> reduced visual acuity <END> . 
it is noteworthy that at first the patients were selected among those with syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> . 
background x-linked <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 ) is caused by mutations in ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> albinism <END> type 1 gene , which encodes a membrane glycoprotein localised to melanosomes . 
as the number of described patients with zinc finger e-box-binding homeobox 2 gene mutations rises , the percentage of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> decreases : 70 % of 30 patients [11 ] , 62 % of 45 [9] , 63 .8 % of 47 [12 ] , 62 .8 % of 70 [4] , 62 ,6 % of 97 [18 ] , 57 .2% of 159 [22] and 57 % of 17 0 . 
considering the high prevalence of <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> in asian indians , htriglycerides as one of the underlining risk factors in the progression of <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary atherosclerosis <END> and no information available on asian indians in this context . 
the investigation of four patients showed that <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of corpus callosum <END> ( present in two patients and absent in two others ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> ( present in one patient and absent in three others ) showed no correlation with paternal origin of the deletion [11 ] . 
furthermore , it also decreases apoe-mediated remnant removal by displacement of apoe from the vldl particles in vivo . additional copies of human apolipoproteinc3gene in transgenic mice were associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> ( htriglycerides) , whereas the absence of the gene in knock out mice leads to reduced triglycerides . 
clinical symptoms are well described and derive from the site of infection ( purulent vaginal discharge , <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> ) and more systemic effects ( <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> anorexia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polyuria <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> polydipsia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> ) [7 ] . 
there were no overt signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> malignancy <END> . 
it causes parasitic <START:PHENOTYPE> bronchitis <END> , also known as dictyocaulosis , which is a disease that typically affects young cattle during their first grazing season in temperate areas . 
we report the development of a new method for diagnosis of heterozygous deletions in <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 gene based on measurement of gene copy number using real-time quantitative pcr from genomic dna . 
conclusion the identification of <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 mutations in families earlier reported as families with hereditary <START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> indicate that <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular albinism <END> type 1 is probably underdiagnosed . 
recently , chemical agents , such as pesticides , have been suggested as possible carcinogens and as factors of <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired spermatogenesis <END> [10 ] . 
the subsequently performed computed tomography ( computed tomography ) scan of the lung showed the typical image of lymphangioleiomyomatosis with numerous thin-walled cysts throughout both lungs , but without <START:PHENOTYPE> spontaneous pneumothorax <END> or chylous <START:PHENOTYPE> pleural effusions <END> ( figure 2 ) . 
epidemiological data and animal studies have implicated airborne particulate matter and diesel exhaust particles in increased morbidity and mortality due to a number of cardiopulmonary diseases including <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder , and lung cancer . 
on the other hand , the phenotypic expression in two affected sisters was very similar for a/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hypoplasia <END> of corpus callosum , <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> [18 ] . 
in fact , two siblings (sister and brother ) with characteristic face , <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> were discordant for <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart disease <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ocular coloboma <END> [17 ] . 
the frequent and severe malformations ( <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> congenital heart defect <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of the corpus callosum <END> ) and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> may lead to suspicion of the diagnosis , but their presence is variable [5 ,9 ,12 ,17 ,18 ,22] . 
further , the degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemia <END> has been shown to be associated with the severity of trauma and subsequent mortality in humans [38 ,39 ] . 
the defibrillators in non-ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> treatment evaluation trial has also been criticized for being underpowered . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> trial ( sudden cardiac death-heft ) is a recently published primary prevention trial . 
there are some important open questions about pecomas : the histogenesis , the normal counterpart of pec and the identification of the histological criteria of <START:PHENOTYPE> malignancy <END> . 
case presentation a 27-year-old woman , who first complained of upper <START:PHENOTYPE> abdominal pain <END> , was referred from a local clinic with the impression of a retroperitoneal haematoma after blunt abdominal trauma 4 months ago . 
in moderate dose , endotoxin causes <START:PHENOTYPE> leukocytosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> and decrease in food consumption , whereas more severe effects are progressive <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> leading to shock and high rates of mortality [ 19 ,31 ] . 
some indication of <START:PHENOTYPE> decreased pulmonary function <END> ( gamble et al 1987 ) and increased mortality from cardiovascular disease ( edling and axelson 1984 ) has also been noted in chronically exposed workers . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> stereotypy <END> , compulsions and voluntary control the checking behavior of rats under quinpirole had been described as " flexible , yet recurrent " . 
indeed , at a point in time when serotonin was thought to be the primary neurotransmitter system in <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> , our early observations with quinpirole were one of the few experimental findings that the authors employed to derive their then novel hypothesis that dopamine may play a role in <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> , a notion favored now for a particular subtype of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> . 
it follows , therefore , that the quinpirole preparation may turn out to be particularly useful for elucidating the role of dopamine circuits in <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> . 
hypertriglyceridemia(htriglycerides ) is a known risk factor for <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> ) in the context of asian indians . 
no chylous <START:PHENOTYPE> ascites <END> was present . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> stereotyped behavior <END> induced by psychostimulant drugs is often conceptualized as consisting of movements that are repetitive , aimless and involuntary . 
no clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis was present and there was no family history of cancer or known <START:PHENOTYPE> genetic disorders <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> mortality accounted for 33% of deaths . 
nevertheless , we suggest below that the difference in the nature of quinpirole-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> compulsive checking behavior <END> and psychostimulant-induced "stereotyped behavior " is one of degree rather than kind . 
the chamber consisted of three pieces : two rectangular slabs and a central knob with a <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> that fits 18 by 21 mm coverslips . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> containing the coverslip was placed perpendicularly to the flow of perfusate . 
inclusion criteria for the trial included ef 35% , symptomatic <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> , and documented ventricular ectopy ( > 10 pvcs /hour ) or non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> on holter monitor or telemetry within the last 6 months [26] . 
a more definitive assessment of the benefit of prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillators implantation in the non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> population was , however , performed in the defibrillators in non-ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> treatment evaluation (defibrillators in non-ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> treatment evaluation ) trial . 
defibrillators in non-ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> treatment evaluation compared the use of the implantable cardioverter defibrillators with standard oral medical therapy vs . medical therapy only of patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> . 
inclusion criteria met by the ten bitches with pyometra were moderately to severely depressed general condition , impaired circulation , <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypothermia <END> or abnormal appearance of visible mucous membranes . 
these cases included one spaying , two ruptured crucial ligaments , one amputation of an injured first phalanx , one dislocated proximal interphalanx joint , one removal of a subcutaneous lump on the hind limb , two tumour mammae and one <START:PHENOTYPE> inguinal hernia <END> . 
clearly , such a description does not apply to the pursuit of validating the quinpirole preparation , as there is nothing arbitrary or subjective in testing for critical properties shared by <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> compulsions and quinpirole-induced checking , especially when those are defined and measured in a strictly objective manner . 
these two smaller trials , evaluating optimal medical therapy [25] and amiodarone [4 ] against prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillators placement , have suggested medical therapy to be as effective as implantable cardioverter defibrillators implantation in preventing all cause mortality in asymptomatic patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> ( non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> ) . 
pecomas are related to the tuberous sclerosis complex ( tuberous sclerosis complex) , characterized by <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> and cellular proliferations . 
clinical features suggest that the zinc finger e-box-binding homeobox 2 gene gene is involved in the development of neural-crest derived cells (enteric nervous system , craniofacial mesectoderm) , central nervous system , heart septation ( <START:PHENOTYPE> patent ductus arteriosus <END> , ventricular and <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial septal defect <END> ) and midline development ( <START:PHENOTYPE> corpus callosum agenesis <END> , genitourinary anomalies and <START:PHENOTYPE> pyloric stenosis <END> ) [5 ,7,25] . 
specifically , because quinpirole is a dopamine agonist , and to the extent that the drug does indeed induce <START:PHENOTYPE> compulsive checking behavior <END> , then the model predicts an involvement of dopamine systems in <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> compulsive checking . 
the amiodarone versus implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in patients with non-ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and asymptomatic nonsustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> ( amiovirt trial ) evaluated empiric amiodarone therapy vs . prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillators implantation in 103 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , ef 35% , and asymptomatic non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> . 
of course , the task to identify which properties of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> are the crucial ones , and how to define them operationally for measurement in the animal , is not a trivial one . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> trial ( <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> trial ) randomized 104 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> to implantable cardioverter defibrillators placement versus optimal medical management and followed them for greater than five years ( 5 .5 2.2 years ) . 
three subjects have been found to have <START:PHENOTYPE> accessory nipples <END> [ 19 ] . 
also many patients enrolled in this trial had <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> from chaga s disease , which is a very different group of patients compared to non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> patients in the us or other parts of the world . 
similarly , chf-stat evaluated the use of amiodarone in a predominantly though not exclusively ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> population with 10 pvcs /hr . 
one of the intriguing findings of this randomized , double blind trial was that <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> suppression with amiodarone had no effect on survival . 
the following features have been reported in at least one affected subject : <START:PHENOTYPE> widely spaced teeth <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dental crowding <END> , "malpositioned " teeth , <START:PHENOTYPE> delayed tooth eruption <END> [ 19 ,34 ] . 
it was previously reported that almost all of the oleic acid-induced <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotension <END> occurred within 0.5 1 hrs after oleic acid administration accompanied by an increase in pulmonary arterial pressure and a decrease in cardiac output [18 ] . 
in this study , we investigated the correlations between survivin mrna expres sion in <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> tissues and clinicopathological parameters . 
methods : there were 22 <START:PHENOTYPE> osteosarcoma <END> patients in our hospital with paraffin-embedded tissues which could be extracted from biopsy specimens . 
using the notion of controllability , <START:PHENOTYPE> stereotypy <END> and compulsions can be viewed as sequential points on a continuum along a dimension of spontaneity . 
interestingly , in a case report on two horses that developed general <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathy <END> after anaesthesia and were subsequently euthanised , a severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypokalemia <END> was observed [63 ] . 
the changes in phosphate in the horses of the present study were rather short lasting , but may be a factor to consider in the development of postoperative <START:PHENOTYPE> myopathies <END> occurring after recovery to standing . 
accordingly , compulsions <START:PHENOTYPE> fall <END> to the right of <START:PHENOTYPE> stereotyped behavior <END> in that there are relatively many stimuli that can modify <START:PHENOTYPE> compulsive behavior <END> and the behavior can be suspended relatively more easily than <START:PHENOTYPE> stereotyped behavior <END> . 
thus , <START:PHENOTYPE> stereotypy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> compulsive behavior <END> may be differentiated by the degree of loss in spontaneity and in particular the extent to which the behavior can be suspended by the organism . 
the other end , a loss in spontaneity , is represented by <START:PHENOTYPE> stereotyped behavior <END> in that it reflects behavior with a narrow range of possible responses , few effective stimuli to modify it , and a limited capacity to suspend ongoing activity . 
repeated <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> attacks , suggestive of <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> , were observed in five cases [25] . 
these findings strengthen the quinpirole preparation as an animal model of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> . 
another one had <START:PHENOTYPE> autonomic dysregulation <END> ( later onset ) [3,22] . 
primary prevention primary prevention of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> is an important goal in the non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> population . 
conclusions like the <START:PHENOTYPE> compulsive behavior <END> of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> patients , so , too , the <START:PHENOTYPE> compulsive checking behavior <END> induced by quinpirole is not irrepressible but can be suspended in the presence of appropriate stimuli . 
analysis of the registry revealed that the overall 2-year survival of patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> was 78 .2% , which was similar to those with cad . 
however , when checking-evoking cues remain , the suspension of checking behavior is not sustained and after a period of time rats resume their checking behavior , akin to the failed resistence that <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> patients show in refraining from performance of their compulsive rituals . 
the gesica trial randomized 516 patients with predominantly non-ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathies <END> and ejection fraction <35 % on optimal medical therapy to amiodarone or placebo [23] . 
two trials using amiodarone in a randomized fashion against placebo have been performed in the non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> population . 
other clinical features one patient with mowat-wilson syndrome had <START:PHENOTYPE> asplenia <END> [18 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> preauricular tag <END> was reported in one individual [1 ] . 
the trial demonstrated a substantial reduction in all cause mortality in patients treated with amiodarone ( 33.5 % vs . 41 .4% rr reduction 28% , 95 % ci 4-45% ) independent of the presence of ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> . 
in order to record the real hemodynamic change trends and the stability of animal models , dopamine was not used and <START:PHENOTYPE> acidosis <END> was not corrected in the present study . 
the registry comprised 73 % of the patients with cad , while the remaining 27% were diagnosed as non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> . 
the possibility of bones deformity , especially knee valgus with <START:PHENOTYPE> depression <END> of the lateral tibial plateau and <START:PHENOTYPE> dislocation <END> of the patella [37] , needs regular orthopedic follow-up . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> nystagmus <END> due to fixation difficulties is frequently described in infancy , but tends to resolve with age [9 ,34 ] . 
the following features have been reported in at least one affected subject : <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> myopia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> astigmatism <END> , dark pigment clumps in blue irises , described as irides heterochromia by some authors [9 ,12 ,34 ] . 
the avid trial , on the other hand , randomized patients resuscitated from ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> to either implantable cardioverter defibrillators therapy or treatment with class iii antiarrhythmic agents ( primarily amiodarone ) [22] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> strabismus <END> , although quite rarely mentioned , was also evident in many photographs and appears to be frequent . 
three had <START:PHENOTYPE> microphthalmia <END> ( one of whom with in addition <START:PHENOTYPE> iris coloboma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> cataract <END> ) , three h ad iris/retinal/optic disc <START:PHENOTYPE> colobomas <END> , and one <START:PHENOTYPE> axenfeld anomaly <END> [17- 19 ,22,28,34 ] . 
54 % of non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> patients received implantable cardioverter defibrillatorss , while 48 % of cad patients received implantable cardioverter defibrillatorss . 
one patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> coloboma <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> high myopia <END> had a novel zinc finger e-box-binding homeobox 2 gene missense mutation and trisomy 21 [28] . 
acute <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> may have several causes such as <START:PHENOTYPE> sepsis <END> , diarrhoea , and glucose infusion , while renal tubule disorders may lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> on a more long-term basis [58 ] . 
in most horses in the present study that showed <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> none of the above-mentioned acute disorders was present . 
reinstitution of feeding in starved people and horses is associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> [59 ,60] , but in such cases the phosphate decrease has a slower onset than was seen in the present study . 
it is of interest to note that in humans , <START:PHENOTYPE> rhabdomyolysis <END> is one of the most common and reproducible consequences of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> [61 ,62 ] . 
also notable in the post-anaesthetic period was the <START:PHENOTYPE> hypophosphatemia <END> that occurred in both groups . 
thus , as pointed out by wolgin , <START:PHENOTYPE> stereotyped behavior <END> is not irrepressible , being subject to control by the organism as well as external stimuli . 
therefore , the notion that <START:PHENOTYPE> stereotyped behavior <END> is an uncontrollable motor automatism is not justified . 
with the advent of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( implantable cardioverter defibrillators ) and their near-perfect termination of lethal <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> , a determination needs to be made of which patients would benefit most from implantable cardioverter defibrillators insertion . 
because the <START:PHENOTYPE> stereotyped behavior <END> induced by psychostimulant drugs is subject to control by external and internal stimuli , therefore , it is not a qualitatively different phenomenon than the quinpirole-induced compulsive checking . 
an audiological evaluation should be performed in all children with <START:PHENOTYPE> language impairment <END> , including mowat-wilson syndrome patients [ 19 ,34 ] . 
however , the two may differ in the degree of controllability , with quinpirole-induced checking being more open to control than the <START:PHENOTYPE> stereotyped behavior <END> induced by other psychostimulant drugs . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hearing loss <END> was not found in patients tested , although children with recurrent or <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic otitis media <END> are at risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> conductive hearing loss <END> [9 ,19 ,34 ] . 
hearing function <START:PHENOTYPE> recurrent episodes of otitis media <END> have been described in patients with mowat-wilson syndrome . 
but <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> has been shown to predominate in small arteries [24] , and <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary hypertension <END> in oleic lung injury results not only from functional factors ( active vasoconstriction ) but also from anatomical factors ( microthrombi ) [25] . 
it has been clearly established that patients with symptomatic sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> and underlying structural heart disease benefit from implantable cardioverter defibrillators implantation irrespective of the etiology of their heart disease [1 0-21] . 
prognosis although there is no systematic follow-up ellis-van creveld syndrome series reported , the prognosis is linked to the <START:PHENOTYPE> respiratory difficulties <END> in the first months of life and these difficulties are related to thoracic narrowness and possible heart defect . 
secondary prevention trials patients with symptomatic non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and documented <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> ) have a mortality rate of up to 22% in the first two years after diagnosis . 
in order to balance the potential risks of device implantation and the associated cost , many investigators have sought to establish risk factors to select patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> who would benefit most from implantable cardioverter defibrillators implantation . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> limb weakness <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis may be associated with complaints of difficulty performing overhead tasks with the arms , and there may be <START:PHENOTYPE> difficulty climbing stairs <END> due to <START:PHENOTYPE> lower extremity weakness <END> . 
in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypospadias <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> it is necessary to take into account the differential diagnosis with smith-lemli-opitz syndrome , opitz g/bbb syndrome and x-linked mental retardation-alpha <START:PHENOTYPE> thalassemia <END> syndrome . 
experience of compulsion as noted by reed , the primary criterial attribute of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> is the experience of compulsion . 
tongue <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> may be demonstrated when the patient attempts to protrude either cheek with the tongue against the resistance of the examiner 's finger applied to the cheek . 
with marked tongue <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , the patient may be unable to protrude the cheek in the absence of applied resistance by the examiner . 
with severe lingual <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , the tongue may not protrude beyond the lips . 
when myasthenic tongue <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> is chronic , tongue atrophy and triple furrowing may develop with accentuated median and lateral lingual furrows . 
neck flexor and extensor muscles are often weak in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
though the neck flexors are usually weaker , a "dropped head syndrome " due to neck extensor <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> may occur . 
although painless <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> is the rule in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , patients with neck extensor <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> may experience posterior neck myalgias . 
results using the blastc13 server at ncbi , we performed in silico cloning studies of the 6p <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> locus to identify coding regions . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> dehydration <END> , abnormal visible mucous membranes and <START:PHENOTYPE> polydipsia <END> were also , but more rarely , described . 
to identify candidate genes for <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> and other disorders mapping to this region we downloaded and searched the two million base pairs of genomic sequence surrounding the peak of transmission disequilibrium . 
etiology autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis results from antibody-mediated , t cell-dependent immunologic attack on the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction . 
in addition to <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> , risk loci for beh et 's disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> inflammatory bowel disease <END> ( ibd3) , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> simplex ( <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> simplex) , insulin dependent type 1 <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <END> )and <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> have all been assigned to this general chromosomal location by genetic linkage analysis . 
examination reveals asymmetrical <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> involving any muscle group in the limbs , though the deltoids , triceps brachii , wrist and finger extensors , and foot dorsiflexors are often involved . 
the differential diagnosis is important for genetic counseling , since goldberg-shprintzen syndrome is autosomal recessive , whereas mowat-wilson syndrome is a sporadic condition . zinc finger e-box-binding homeobox 2 gene mutation analysis may be also considered in patients with syndromic [43 ] and apparently non-syndromic <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> disease and no mutation in other related genes such as ret or ednrb [20,48 ,49 ] . 
various restriction fragment length polymorphisms in and around the human apolipoproteinc3gene have been associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> in several distinct populations . 
this , combined with <START:PHENOTYPE> absent speech <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> , has led some individuals to be given a presumptive diagnosis of angelman syndrome [ 19 ] . 
a patient with short segment <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , and distinct facial appearance in the absence of zinc finger e-box-binding homeobox 2 gene intragenic mutations was diagnosed as goldberg-shprintzen syndrome [30] . 
however , in the face of the compulsion-evoking situation , this avoidance would become unavailing , and , inevitably , the <START:PHENOTYPE> compulsive behavior <END> would emerge . 
it has been suggested that certain haplotypes generated from ssti polymorphism and promoter polymorphism of apolipoproteinc3gene may protect or predispose to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> . 
in seropositive <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , binding of antibody to the acetylcholine receptor initiates autoimmune attack on the endplate region . 
abnormal neuromuscular transmission and clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis result from the effects of antibodies that bind to various epitopes of the skeletal muscle endplate region . 
we also excluded significant cardiovascular morbidity , such as coronary heart disease and <START:PHENOTYPE> stroke <END> history in our study population . 
in most cases , antibodies bind to the main immunogenic region of the -subunit of the acetylcholine receptor , though <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients with antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase exhibit clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> and electrophysiologic findings that are quite similar to <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients with acetylcholine receptor antibodies . muscle-specific tyrosine kinase initiates aggregation of acetylcholine receptors at the muscle endplate during development , [2 ] but the function of muscle-specific tyrosine kinase in mature skeletal muscle and the pathophysiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis related to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies are currently unknown . 
t-lymphocyte tolerance to self-antigens is established in the thymus , and thymic abnormalities are often present in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
short tandem repeat marker ja04 , which identified the peak of transmission disequilibrium for <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> phenotypes in previous studies , is at 540 kb . 
thymic hyperplasia is observed in about 65 % of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients , and <START:PHENOTYPE> thymomas <END> are present in about 10 % of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients [14 ] . 
the functional loss of acetylcholine receptors reduces the probability of successful neuromuscular transmission following quantal release of acetylcholine by the motor nerve terminal , resulting in clinical <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> in striated muscles . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis and other <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disorders <END> result from the loss of tolerance to self-antigens . 
repetitive nerve stimulation studies are relatively more sensitive in generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis and relatively less sensitive in ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis [20] . 
in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , when repetitive nerve stimulation studies are performed in a hand and in a shoulder muscle , the overall sensitivity is approximately 60% . 
accordingly , patients with seronegative and ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis are less likely to have <START:PHENOTYPE> thymomas <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> thymoma <END> have more severe and <START:PHENOTYPE> generalized weakness <END> , higher acetylcholine receptor antibody titers , and more severe electrophysiologic abnormalities . 
the father had <START:PHENOTYPE> short stature <END> ( 15 0 cm , vietnamese origin) , somewhat <START:PHENOTYPE> uplifted earlobes <END> and a pointed nasal tip [18 ] . 
the biochemical basis for the association of s2 allele with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> has yet to be established . 
animal model of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> we noted previously that compulsive checking may share mechanisms with drug-induced sensitization , as both phenomena are induced by quinpirole and exhibit similar features . 
logistic analysis revealed a significant association of apolipoproteinc3 s2 allele with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> ( table 3 ) . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> are frequent and <START:PHENOTYPE> psychomotor delay <END> , particularly serious in spoken language , is constant . 
transcatheter radiofrequency atrioventricular node ablation followed by ventricular pacing has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life of the patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
they concluded that av junction ablation with permanent pacing had a significantly greater ability to decrease the frequency of attacks and the extent of symptoms of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> , and more satisfaction with their general well-being among these patients . 
lee et al . compared the long-term effects of complete av junction ablation with those of av junction modification in patients with medically refractory <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [50 ] . 
although <START:PHENOTYPE> external ophthalmoplegia <END> may occur in either disorder , dysthyroid ophthalmopathy produces <START:PHENOTYPE> proptosis <END> , not ptosis , owing to enlarged extraocular muscles . 
they concluded that atrioventricular node modification is expected to be more effective , safe and expeditious in patients with chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> and a b type rr interval distribution pattern whereas u pattern patients may benefit from partial injury to the atrioventricular node and that posterior atrionodal input ablation may be the mechanism for rate control in these patients . 
jaw closure muscles are frequently affected in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , but strength is usually normal in jaw opening muscles . 
serious malformations ( <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> , heart disease , <START:PHENOTYPE> agenesis of corpus callosum <END> ) are common even if not always present . 
a finding of normal jitter in a clinically weak muscle virtually excludes <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis as a cause of <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> in that muscle . 
edner et al . reported that in patients with left ventricular dysfunction long term improvement of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function was seen after ablation of the atrioventricular junction for rate control of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> [52 ] . 
when a facial and a limb muscle are studied , sfe <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is over 97 % sensitive for detecting myasthenia gravis [23] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> ovarian fibroma <END> 6 . 
clinical features were mild in comparison with these associated with truncating mutations , no malformations or <START:PHENOTYPE> seizures <END> were present . 
some children may have only <START:PHENOTYPE> rib anomalies <END> , whilst others have the " typical face " without other signs . 
moreover , we examined whether a pharmacological agent used in the treatment of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> produces an amelioration of checking in the quinpirole preparation . 
in this context , we asked previously what characteristics define the spatiotemporal structure of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> checking and examined whether the same features are found in the behavior of quinpirole-treated rats . 
overexpression of apoconfidence intervalii produces <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertriglyceridemia <END> in transgenic mouse models via inhibition of clearance of triglycerides-rich particles . 
similarly , in the present study , we investigated whether the expression of checking in the quinpirole preparation is subject to external inhibitory control as it is the case for compulsive checking in <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> . 
the patients with goldberg-shprintzen syndrome ( actually mim 609460 ) share clinical features such as <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> , but have a different facial gestalt ( <START:PHENOTYPE> high nasal bridge <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> synophrys <END> , long curled eyelashes , palpebral <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> are commonly observed ) [45 ,46 ] . 
our focus on quinpirole-induced checking as a possible animal model of <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> , stemmed from serendipitous observations of an apparent surface similarity of the drug-induced behavior to that of the motor compulsions of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive-compulsive disorder <END> . 
differential diagnosis the facial features of patients with mowat-wilson syndrome are quite characteristic , but the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> hirschsprung disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> epilepsy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> mental retardation <END> may initially suggest goldberg-shprintzen syndrome ( goldberg-shprintzen syndrome ) [5 ] . 
myasthenic <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of laryngeal muscles is associated with a hoarse , breathy voice . 
while there exist different types of validity by which to evaluate animal models of <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric disorders <END> , our process of validation of the quinpirole preparation does not fit neatly into any one of the described types . 
about one-half of prepubertal children with <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis are seronegative [26] . 
with <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of palatal muscles , <START:PHENOTYPE> nasal speech <END> develops as air escapes through the nose . 
however , in a recent study to assess the long-term effect of atrioventricular node ablation and ventricular pacing on left ventricular ejection fraction ( left ventricular ejection fraction ) in patients with permanent <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> , szili-torok et al . concluded that restoration of a regular ventricular rhythm following atrioventricular node ablation for patients in permanent atrial fibrillation does not result in improvement in left ventricular function [55 ] . 
in severe lower <START:PHENOTYPE> facial weakness <END> , the lips cannot be voluntarily opposed . 
chromium deficiency is rare in animals and can lead to <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired glucose tolerance <END> , hyperglycaemia , relative <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> peripheral neuropathy <END> , and metabolic <START:PHENOTYPE> encephalopathy <END> [52 ,5 ] . 
the assay is very specific , and positive antibody studies confirm <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis in a patient with appropriate symptoms and clinical findings . acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies are present in approximately 80% of patients with generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , but in only 55 % of patients with ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis [24,25] . 
oropharyngeal <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle weakness <END> produces <START:PHENOTYPE> dysarthria <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> . 
patients with mild lower <START:PHENOTYPE> facial weakness <END> develop a transverse pucker when they attempt to hold air within inflated cheeks . 
they also hypothesized that heart rate control would lead to an improvement in papillary muscle function , with a relation between a reduction in <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral regurgitation <END> and improved functional class . 
with more overt lower <START:PHENOTYPE> facial weakness <END> , air readily escapes through the lips when the cheeks are squeezed . 
brown et al . hypothesized that the observed improvement in ejection fraction with control of the persistently rapid ventricular response to <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> would account for the improved functional class in these patients [54 ] . 
according to their study , although the ejection fraction improved in 53 % and <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral regurgitation <END> decreased in 57 % , the improvement could not be explained entirely by either a change in ejection fraction or reduction of <START:PHENOTYPE> mitral regurgitation <END> . 
they reported 15 patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> and severe <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> who had marked functional improvement after av nodal ablation with vvir pacemaker implantation . 
it is synthesised in the liver and its deficiency leads to <START:PHENOTYPE> anaemia <END> and deposition of iron as haemosiderin in tissues , especially in the liver [29,23] . 
incomplete glottic closure during swallowing may produce <START:PHENOTYPE> aspiration <END> . 
false positive results have also been reported in motor neuron disease , patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> thymoma <END> without <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , and relatives of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis [27] . 
rarely , false positive results in acetylcholine receptor binding antibody assays have been observed in patients with other <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune diseases <END> such as <START:PHENOTYPE> systemic lupus erythematosus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> rheumatoid arthritis <END> , and inflammatory <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> . 
though relatively less sensitive than sfe <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies are highly specific for autoimmune myasthenia gravis .

the patient , a six-month-old girl , had dysmorphic features typical of mowat-wilson syndrome , <START:PHENOTYPE> microcephaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> severe psychomotor retardation <END> . 
however , a blanket inference that all drugs that induce sensitization produce <START:PHENOTYPE> compulsive behavior <END> seems unwarranted without a series of validation studies as being done for quinpirole [ ; present study ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> macrocephaly <END> determin the radiation field after adjustment for height 2 . 
they were admitted to the clinic 10 65 days after the beginning of vaginal <START:PHENOTYPE> bleeding <END> , according to the owners . 
congenital malformation : <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft lip or palate <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> frontal bossing <END> , " coarse face " , moderate of severe <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertelorism <END> 3 . 
other skeletal abnormalities : <START:PHENOTYPE> sprengel deformity <END> , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> pectus deformity <END> , marked <START:PHENOTYPE> syndactyly <END> of the digits 4 . 
autopsies of such cases reveal severe <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle atrophy <END> and a complete lack of visible fat " complete emaciation " as a main finding . 
necrotic <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> occurred in two pigs , which died at post infection day 14 . 
after age 50 , new cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis are slightly more common in men with a ratio of 3:2 [10 ,11 ] . 
in the cerebrums and cerebellums , similar <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> was observed as in experiment i , with severe degenerative changes ( figure 6 ) from post infection day 10 until the end of the experiment in almost all pigs . 
juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disorder <END> , while congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis results from genetic mutations that impair neuromuscular transmission . 
pediatric <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is very rare . 
it may be difficult to make the distinction between juvenile <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis and congenital <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , particularly in the absence of acetylcholine receptor or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies , or a clear history of <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> and other manifestations of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotonia <END> from the time of birth that would suggest genetic disease . 
transient neonatal <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is a self-limited disorder related to placental antibody transfer in maternal autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
clinical description in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , patients present with fluctuating and fatigable <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of specific muscle groups rather than with generalized fatigue or pain . 
sustained exercise and increased body temperature may increase the degree of <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> . 
the <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> is variable from day to day and from hour to hour , but it is generally worse later in the day . 
ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> with asymmetric <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> and binocular <START:PHENOTYPE> diplopia <END> is the most common initial presentation , while early or isolated oropharyngeal or <START:PHENOTYPE> limb weakness <END> is less common . 
background free-living reindeer are subjected to seasonal changes in food quality and availability , and <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> in winter due to sub-maintenance feed intake , inanition , is regarded as normal . 
knight et al . prospectively followed 14 patients who presented with unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> and who were diagnosed with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , and had negative electrophysiology study [29] along with a control group of 19 patients with non ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy who sustained a <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrest <END> . 
we identified 19 genes within 2 mb of the peak of transmission disequilibrium but are some better candidates for <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> than others ? 
during the 24 13 months of follow-up , 5 0 % of patients with unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> received appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillators shocks in comparison to 42 % of the patients who received an implantable cardioverter defibrillators for <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrest <END> ( p= 0.1 ) . 
discussion the primary goal of this study was to identify candidate genes surrounding the peak of transmission disequilibrium for <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> on chromosome 6p and to characterize their patterns of expression . 
time to first appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillators shock actually occurred earlier in the <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> patients as compared to those with <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrest <END> (32 7 vs . 72 12 months , p = 0.01 ) . 
however , the trend suggests that <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> is a marker for arrhythmic death in patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> . 
fonarow et al . evaluated 147 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , and severely decreased left ventricular function [30] . 
wet weight to dry weight ratio measurements lung tissue blocks were also obtained from right lungs for wet- to dry-weight ratio ( w/d ) measurement to evaluate the severity of <START:PHENOTYPE> pulmonary edema <END> [15 ] . 
one report evaluated the role of this test in 145 patients with a history of pre <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> or syncope . 
while this trial was non-randomized , the implantable cardioverter defibrillators group had significantly improved 2-year survival although they had more frequent ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> during monitoring ( 56 % vs . 15 % p= 0.0001 ) . 
the following findings were noted [33 ] : patients with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> were more likely to have a positive test compared to those with a single episode or with recurrent presyncope ( 41 versus 17 percent , p< 0.005 ) . 
patients with structural heart disease or with a noncardiovascular cause for <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> were less likely to have a positive test ( 16 versus 42 percent , p< 0.0001 ) . 
when multiple factors were combined , the yield ranged from 0 percent in patients under 50 without recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> who had structural heart disease or a noncardiovascular cause to 73 percent in those over 50 with recurrent <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> who did not have structural heart disease or a non-cardiovascular cause . 
the handful of described cases were originally diagnosed by anomalous gaba metabolites in the urine associated with developmental and <START:PHENOTYPE> speech delays <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyporeflexia <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> behavioral problems <END> including mild <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> with clinical variation between affected family members . 
in some cases the vascular lesions were accompanied by focal <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> . 
another study evaluated the role of the tilt study in patients with bifascicular block who had unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> . 
when compared to those with bifascicular block and no <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , no difference in the incidence of a positive tilt test was observed , suggesting that test specificity in this population is of concern [34 ] . 
in skeletal muscles a necrotic <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> was seen in two pigs at post infection day 14 . 
in kidneys , a very mild focal <START:PHENOTYPE> interstitial nephritis <END> with mononuclear cells was seen in about the half of the animals throughout the observation period . 
ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> presents as fluctuating , fatigable , and sometimes alternating <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> and binocular <START:PHENOTYPE> diplopia <END> that resolves with closing or covering one eye . 
in addition , a focal mononuclear <START:PHENOTYPE> perivasculitis <END> in the medulla was detected in two pigs at 60 hours , respective four days after infection . 
examination may demonstrate asymmetrical <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> of multiple extraocular muscles that cannot be attributed to a single cranial <START:PHENOTYPE> neuropathy <END> . 
retrospectively , many patients report periods of intermittent <START:PHENOTYPE> blurred vision <END> before they were able to discern dual visual images . 
he showed a mild motor and <START:PHENOTYPE> speech delay <END> but , by age 5 years , he spoke in full sentences . 
dysthyroid ( graves ) ophthalmopathy may coexist with ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> is generally asymmetrical , and it may be associated with ipsilateral frontalis muscle contraction to help compensate for the weak levator palpebrae . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> may be elicited or increased with sustained upgaze . 
these studies suggest that unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> in patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> is a grave prognostic indicator with a significant proportion benefiting from implantable cardioverter defibrillators implantation ; 
a negative glutaraldehyde test can be used as a semiquantitative indicator of <START:PHENOTYPE> hypogammaglobulinemia <END> caused by failure of passive transfer of colostrum in neonatal foals [2 ,7 ,36 ,8 ,21 ,15 ,4] , calves [43 ,18 ,22,19 ,44 ,42] , kids [45 ,41 ] , and zoo ruminants [34 ,5 ,14 ] . 
the incidence of non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> in patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> varies from 33 to 79 % [31-32 ] . 
however that is not to imply that absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> confers any protection from sudden death . 
electrocardiographic monitoring the prognostic influence of electrocardiographic monitoring for the presence of ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> has been debated for nearly two decades . 
of the two patients who suffered sudden death during follow-up , one had no evidence of ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> at baseline . 
huang et al . followed 35 patients with recently diagnosed non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> that had ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring to evaluate for ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> [33 ] . 
at baseline , 83 % had frequent pvcs , 93 % had complex pvcs and 60 % of patients had non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> . 
beh et 's disease is an <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disorder <END> characterized by a systemic <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> that affects the joints , all sizes and types of blood vessels , the lungs , the central nervous system , and the gastrointestinal tract . 
while this study showed a high incidence of non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> in the non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> population , it was not powered to show any correlation between non-sustained <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> and sudden death . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> simplex results in the complete loss of scalp hair in childhood . 
the five brain candidate genes described above for <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> are also reasonable candidates for the neurobehavioral disorders <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> attention deficit hyperactivity disorder <END> . 
betz et aldescribed evidence for linkage to <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> simplex with markers spanning d6s276 (400 kb telomeric of ja04 ) through d6s1607 ( 5 .6mb centromeric of ja04 ) . 
if the patient experiences <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of consciousness <END> or is unable to maintain posture in association with a significant <START:PHENOTYPE> fall <END> in blood pressure or heart rate , he or she is returned to a supine position , and the test is considered positive . 
canis infections in dogs are usually asymptomatic , but may cause severe diarrhoea , malabsortion and <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> [12 ] . 
our finding concur with reports from germany indicating that there is a higher risk of <START:PHENOTYPE> erysipelas <END> in laying hens housed in litter-based housing systems ( including free-range ) than in caged birds [10 ,19 ] . 
these genes may also serve as candidates for other <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disorders <END> that map to this region such as ibd3 . 
firm criteria for <START:PHENOTYPE> malignancy <END> and proper subclassifications of pecomas have yet to be established and should be validated by case reports and studies of clinical behaviour . 
conclusion in summary , we examined 2 mb surrounding the transmission disequilibrium peak with <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> at short tandem repeat marker ja04 on chromosome 6p . 
many investigators require either <START:PHENOTYPE> loss of consciousness <END> or postural tone to consider the test positive while isoproterenol is infused . 
one study found that a single-stage isoproterenol tilt table test more frequently induced <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> than a standard passive tilt study ( 56 versus 32 percent ) and reduced the time necessary for the procedure . 
tilt testing is also of limited value for patients with situational vagal <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> , i.e. , syncope due to situations associated with enhanced vagal tone such as micturition , defecation , cough , or <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> [35 ] . 
in the fifth decade , new cases of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis are evenly distributed between men and women . 
the onset of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is influenced by gender and age in a bimodal fashion . 
epidemiology although <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is rare , prevalence rates for <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis have increased over time , likely due to improvements in diagnosis and treatment . 
comparisons of patients without documented <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular tachycardia <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> ventricular fibrillation <END> but with a history of unexplained <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> and patients who have survived documented <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiac arrest <END> reveal similar mortality [29] . 
in one particular trial 23 patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> were compared to a similar group of 201 patients that did not have <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> [28] . 
we conclude therefore that in silico cloning is a powerful and effective technique for quickly identifying existing and novel genes , which can then be used to develop cdna single nucleotide polymorphism markers ( cdna single nucleotide polymorphism markers ) for pinpointing a more precise location of the 6p <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> gene , and other disease genes that map to this region . 
history of <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> [28-30] , electrocardiographic monitoring [31-36] , programmed electrical stimulation ( programmed electrical stimulation ) [37-56 ] , signal-averaged ecg (signal-averaged ecg ) [56-58 ] , heart rate variability [48-59 ] , qt dispersion [46 ] , and baroreceptor sensitivity testing [60] , heart rate turbulence [63-65 ] have all been evaluated . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> may be a harbinger of <START:PHENOTYPE> sudden cardiac death <END> . 
it is believed that benefit would be more readily achievable if a higher risk subgroup could be selected instead of allocating this expensive therapy to the broad population of patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> . 
a number of diagnostic methods have been used to risk stratify patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathy <END> for elevated risk for sudden death . 
the majority of giardia infections in dogs are asymptomatic , but some infected dogs may suffer from acute or chronic diarrhoea , <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> poor weight gain <END> despite a normal appetite , and , less commonly , <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> lethargy <END> [20] . 
risk stratification based on the primary prevention trials there seems to be still some controversy regarding improved survival with implantable cardioverter defibrillators therapy in patients with non ischemic <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> . 
however , 83 % of the mortality in the <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> group was due to sudden death , compared to 32 % in the control group ( p < 0.025 ) . 
this trial was non-randomized , with more frequent use of amiodarone in the <START:PHENOTYPE> syncope <END> group ( p < 0.04 ) . 
they must use 100% uv protectin the radiation fieldsunglasses as the skin surrounding the eyes (similar to that of the nose/ears ) is vulnerable to <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> . 
in cerebrum and cerebellum , the main changes were confined to the vessels in form of <START:PHENOTYPE> vasculitis <END> consisting of infiltration of mononuclear cells into the wall and around the small blood vessels , most frequently in meninges and white matter . 
although the mechanism of action in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is unknown , corticosteroids have numerous effects on the immune system including reduction of cytokine production [39 ] . 
unlike most fat-derived peptides , circulating levels are inversely proportional to <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and therefore tend to be low in <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> . 
corticosteroids corticosteroids are the most widely used immune modulating agents for <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
adiponectin levels increase with <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> and with use of insulin sensitizing drugs . 
although mutational analysis of the coding region of tropomodulin 2 in <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> 5 and tropomodulin 4 in limb girdle <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> 1b patients failed to reveal any point mutations , small deletions , or polymorphisms , we did find that tropomodulin 2 and tropomodulin 4 consist of nine coding exons and at least one 5 ' untranslated exon (e0 ) . 
signs of cholinergic crisis include <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> indistinguishable from myasthenic <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle fasciculations <END> , and symptoms of increased muscarinic activity including <START:PHENOTYPE> bradycardia <END> . 
a study done by gasparini et al et al [61 ] examined the importance of underlying cardiac pathology on the outcome of cardiac resynchronization therapy , hypothesizing that <START:PHENOTYPE> myocardial infarction <END> scar and the non-contractile segment represent limitations to the ability to resynchronize cardiac contraction in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> . 
in cholinergic crises , depolarization blockade at diseased neuromuscular junctions results in increased <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , and increased muscarinic activity generates copious oropharyngeal and bronchial secretions that may obstruct the airway or be aspirated . 
[16 ] low levels of adiponectin have been linked to inflammatory arthrosclerosis in humans .[17 ] animal models have shown that low adiponectin levels increase smooth muscle proliferation in response to injury , increase free fatty acids levels and cause <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> .[18 ] the pro-diabetic and pro-atherogenic effects of low adiponectin levels seen in the metabolic syndrome provide a link between inflammation and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> . 
results from several epin the radiation fieldiologic studies have indicated that the risks of <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> show a strong positin the radiation fieldcorrelation with exposure to uv radiation . 
in kidneys , six pigs had a very mild focal mononuclear <START:PHENOTYPE> interstitial nephritis <END> between 12 hours and 2 days after inoculation . 
etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> and cardiac resynchronization therapy the mechanisms of <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> dilated cardiomyopathy <END> are complex and multiple . 
cholinergic crisis may develop with excessive dosing of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in patients with more severe <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 are elevated in acute conditions such as <START:PHENOTYPE> deep venous thrombosis <END> , and chronic conditions such as <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , the metabolic syndrome of aging and diabetes . 
the most salient side effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors relate to increased muscarinic activity and include <START:PHENOTYPE> nausea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> vomiting <END> , abdominal cramping , <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diaphoresis <END> , and increased lacrimation , salivation , and bronchial secretions . 
however , there were foci of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal dysplasia <END> , characterized by rosette formation ( figure 4m ) . 
[ 19 ] levels are decreased by <START:PHENOTYPE> weight loss <END> and drugs that improve insulin sensitivity [20] . 
the relationship of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 to <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> provides a potential link between the metabolic syndrome and hypercoagulabilty . 
this protein , putatively involved in <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> , is an inhibitor of cell death induced by various apoptotic stimuli , including tnf- . the third identified gene , rsu1 , encodes ras suppressor protein 1 , which is involved in tnf- signaling by blocking the ras-dependent response . 
levels of both rsu1 mrna and protein have been correlated with a decrease in growth rate and tumorigenic potential in u251 <START:PHENOTYPE> glioblastoma <END> cells and it induces growth arrest in pc12 cells . 
the use of these endophenotypic measures are potentially advantageous for genetics studies since they may show increased sensitivity to specific dimensions related to complex <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric disorders <END> . 
bryostatin 1 rescues ifn-gamma inducibility of major histocompatibility complex class ii in ls1034 <START:PHENOTYPE> colon carcinoma <END> cells to evaluate potential clinical implications of our findings , we asked whether the ifn-gamma-dependent major histocompatibility complex class ii expression in ls1034 cells could be restored by clinically achievable concentrations of protein kinase c agonists . 
physiological ifn-gamma response in sw480 <START:PHENOTYPE> colon carcinoma <END> cells was resistant to inhibition with 1 m gf 109203x and was suppressed only when staurosporine concentration was increased to 1 m . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> paroxysmal atrial fibrillation <END> can also recur . 
ablation of the pulmonary vein focus for <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> is a long-lasting procedure with possible complications , such as pulmonary vein stenosis , <START:PHENOTYPE> thromboembolism <END> , air embolism , hemopericardium , and possible damage to such adjacent structures such as bronchioles , the right pulmonary artery , and lung tissue . 
these potentials have to be differentiated from those of the ligament of marshall and the right atrium , which can also be foci of <START:PHENOTYPE> paroxysmal atrial fibrillation <END> . 
a rapidly firing focus may be the mechanism for <START:PHENOTYPE> paroxysmal atrial fibrillation <END> , but 1 or 2 pulmonary vein ectopic beats may also initiate atrial fibrillation in the presence of an additional substrate in the left or right atrium . 
the strong correlation between <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> implies that adipose tissue may play a role in blood pressure regulation and in fact there is a correlation between circulating angiotesinogen levels and <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> / <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> [21] . 
animal studies have shown that overexpression of angiotesinogen results in <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> while under expression of angiotesinogen results in decreased blood pressures [22] . 
requests for prenatal testing for conditions such as nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome that do not affect intellect , have variable expression and for which some treatments are available , are not common . 
very rarely , <START:PHENOTYPE> fibroma <END> of the heart may be detected . 
in muscles , very mild focal acute muscle degeneration to variable degree and <START:PHENOTYPE> oedema <END> were observed in all the three infected groups and control animals , throughout the experiment ( results not repeated below ) . 
resistin is a peptide which is elevated in <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> and appears to play a role in glucose homeostasis in rodents . 
occasional patients are unable to tolerate an alternating-day regimen due to mood instability , variation in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , or difficult glycemic control in occasional diabetic patients . 
in experimental models , resistin induces hepatic <START:PHENOTYPE> insulin resistance <END> while anti-resistin antibodies have the opposite effect [23] . 
some fetuses with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome have <START:PHENOTYPE> large heads <END> and so may need assistance in delin the radiation fieldy either by forceps or by cesarian section . 
marked improvement or remission was achieved in 80% <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis patients in one large series with a 3.1 month mean time to marked improvement and a median time to maximum benefit between five and six months [40 ] . 
prednisone treatment produced significant improvement in strength within two to three weeks in retrospective studies of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis [40 ,41 ] , and a cochrane review cites significant short term benefit in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis with corticosteroids [42 ] . 
these agents may produce rapid improvement in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , though they are often associated with the liability of significant dose-dependent side effects and occasionally elicit transient and potentially serious myasthenic exacerbations within the first two weeks of treatment . 
corticosteroids are often used as the initial immunotherapy in patients with ocular and generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , particularly in patients with unsatisfactory responses to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors . 
bryostatin 1 is a potent protein kinase c activator that has undergone extensive clinical testing for the treatment of hematological <START:PHENOTYPE> malignancies <END> and solid tumors . 
the short-term results of pulmonary vein ablation are promising but uncertainty exists about long-term results with regard to <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> recurrence and mechanical complications such as development of pulmonary vein stenosis . 
the last problem concerns the long-term results of pulmonary vein ablation in <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
eyes with extensively opaque corneas or obvious <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> were not used for electroretinography assessment , and mice with <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachments <END> were dropped from the study . 
as an initial assessment of this approach , we chose four candidate genes (drd4 , dat1 , catecholamine-o-methyl transferase and monoamine oxidase ) that are among the most widely studied and repeatedly associated with various <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric disorders <END> where attention is found to be disrupted . 
we found that protein kinase c activators rescued high levels of major histocompatibility complex class ii expression in <START:PHENOTYPE> colon carcinoma <END> cells and failed to do so in mesothelioma and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatocellular carcinoma <END> cells . 
in some cases the vascular changes were accompanied by focal <START:PHENOTYPE> gliosis <END> . 
for example this was >15 0 ms for the multisite stimulation in <START:PHENOTYPE> cardiomyopathies <END> study17 , >130 ms in the miracle study16 , and >12 0 ms in comparison of medical therapy , pacing , and defibrillation in chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> ( companion ) trial [46 ] . 
to minimize <START:PHENOTYPE> osteopenia <END> , calcium carbonate 1500 mg/day and vitamin d 600 iu/day are recommended . 
a high protein , low fat , low carbohydrate , low sodium diet is recommended to prevent untoward weight gain , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlipidemia <END> , and fluid retention . 
recently , the translin-associated factor x gene ( translin-associated factor x gene ) was demonstrated to intergenically splice into disrupted in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> gene 1 ( disrupted in <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> gene 1 ) . 
these include : <START:PHENOTYPE> hypertension <END> , fluid retention , weight gain , potassium loss , <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperlipidemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> osteoporosis <END> , gastric ulceration , <START:PHENOTYPE> cataracts <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> , moon facies , <START:PHENOTYPE> obesity <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> acne <END> , skin friability , juvenile growth suppression , and mood/personality changes . 
severe <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachments <END> were observed as early as four months and their incidence increased with age . 
the post mortem examinations showed birds with acute , septicaemic disease with <START:PHENOTYPE> splenomegaly <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> hepatomegaly <END> as the most prominent lesions . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> was initiated by a single focal discharge in 3 patients , short burst of two or more repetitive focal discharges in 40 , and both mechanisms in 2 patients . 
phb encodes the protein prohibitin , a potential tumor-suppressor protein that binds to the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> ) protein and represses e2f transcriptional activity . 
valvular <START:PHENOTYPE> endocarditis <END> , necrotic hepatitis , and necrotic splenitis were observed sporadically . 
we then examined genetic polymorphisms in four candidate genes (drd4 , dat , catecholamine-o-methyl transferase and monoamine oxidase ) that have been shown to contribute to the risk of developing various <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric disorders <END> where attention is disrupted . 
cdh13 , encoding cadherin 13 , is significantly downregulated in human <START:PHENOTYPE> breast carcinoma <END> cell lines and <START:PHENOTYPE> breast cancer <END> , whereas its overexpression decreases tumor-cell growth . 
outbreaks of <START:PHENOTYPE> erysipelas <END> , caused by erysipelothrixysipelothrixcherichiacherichiaysipelothrix ( erysipelothrixcherichia ) rhusiopathiae , were observed in ten of 129 flocks from indoor litter-based housing systems and in six of 23 flocks from free-range systems but not in any caged flock . 
posterior segment abnormalities ophthalmoscopic analysis of bmp4+ /- but not bmp4+ / + mice revealed irregular white <START:PHENOTYPE> patches <END> in the vitreous and dense vitreous haze in the majority of eyes examined ( figure 4a ) . 
the birds had shown signs of <START:PHENOTYPE> paralysis <END> and high mortality . 
telemetry and 24-hour holter monitoring were performed to identify the cumulative duration of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> and its frequency . 
al ( 1996 ) reported that the <START:PHENOTYPE> myelodysplasia <END> syndrome 1( mds1 ) gene spliced into exon 2 of the adjacent ecotropic viral integration site 1( evi1 ) gene , producing a unique transcript containing an orf that produces a gata-binding transcriptional activator . 
in this study 158 <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> patients ( 121 men , mean age 65 years , mean left ventricularef 0.29 , mean qrs width 174 ms ) underwent successful biventricular implantation and were then followed for a mean time of 11 .2 months . 
electrodessication and curettage is a very common procedure used as an alternatin the radiation fieldto topical chemotherapy in the treatment of small <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> located in low recurrence areas of the body ( neck , trunk , extremities ) [148 ] . 
nevertheless , a study of high-dose oral isotretinoin ( mean daily dose : 3 mg/kg/day ) found that only 8 % of <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> underwent complete clinical and histological regression , whin the radiation fieldall patients developed moderate-to-severe acute toxicity [140 ] . 
in one pig , which died at post infection day 12 , acute <START:PHENOTYPE> pyelonephritis <END> was observed . 
this syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition with complete penetrance and variable expressivity , characterised by the presence of multiple nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> of the skin , multiple ( synchronous or metachronous ) <START:PHENOTYPE> odontogenic keratocysts of the jaws <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> skeletal abnormalities <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ectopic calcifications <END> and plantar or <START:PHENOTYPE> palmar pits <END> . 
in addition it has been considered a key criteria for selecting <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> patients for cardiac resynchronization therapy , as wide qrs has been suggested to be associated with marked right ventricular to left ventricular and intra-left ventricular dyssynchrony [10 ,25,54 ] . 
qrs duration and dyssynchrony wide qrs duration , possibly with left bundle branch block , has been proposed as an independent predictor of total mortality in <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> patients [51-53 ] . 
in one of these animals focal acute fibrinotic <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> with necrosis was also seen at post infection day 14 . 
however , the correlation between the qrs width and regional electromechanical left ventricular dyssynchrony has not been completely clarified [47 ,55 ,56 ] and a high prevalence of left ventricular systolic and diastolic asynchrony has been found in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> and normal qrs duration [57 ] . 
recent studies indicated that imiquimod 5 % cream appears to be an effectin the radiation fieldtreatment for nodular <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> alone [141-145 ] , or if combin the radiation field with curettage prior to its application [146 ] . 
in fact , 17 nodular <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> on 15 patients were treated by curettage without electrodesiccation followed by once-daily application of imiquimod 5 % cream , 5 tin the radiation field per week for 6 weeks ; 
lastly , this study further validates the attention network test as an endophenotypic assay suitable for assessing how genes influence certain anatomical networks that may be disrupted in various <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric disorders <END> . 
background an inability to select and maintain mental focus is commonly observed in many heritable <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric disorders <END> . 
the abnormal vitreous vessels ( figure 4e and 4g ) were frequently associated with the formation of adhesions between the retina and lens capsule that exerted traction on the retina resulting in <START:PHENOTYPE> retinal detachment <END> in approximately 25% of the bmp4+ /-mice examined and occurred as early as p30 . 
for example , patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> schizophrenia <END> exhibit difficulties in sensorimotor gating , smooth pursuit eye-tracking , set-shiftingand working memory tasks . 
this suggests that deficits in attentional performance may contribute to the genetic susceptibility or liability of complex <START:PHENOTYPE> psychiatric disorders <END> . 
children with attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder ( attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder ) exhibit abnormal performance in sustained attention taskswhile studies on <START:PHENOTYPE> autism <END> reveal slowed covert orienting of visual spatial attentionand patients with alzheimer 's disease show covert orienting deficits . 
after 9 3 months , 22 patients ( 85% ) were <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> -free , including 62 % not taking and 23% taking antiarrhythmic drugs , with no difference ( p=ns ) between paroxysmal and permanent atrial fibrillation . 
among 14 patients in <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> at the beginning of the procedure , 64 % had sinus rhythm restoration during ablation . 
they selected 26 patients with resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> , either paroxysmal or permanent . 
nma , encoding a putative transmembrane protein , is expressed at low levels in metastatic human <START:PHENOTYPE> melanoma <END> cell lines and xenografts , and is completely absent in highly metastatic human <START:PHENOTYPE> melanoma <END> cell lines . 
however , this choice may be limited by technical difficulties like high capture threshold from the presence of scar or fibrosis , particularly in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> , determining high left ventricular pacing threshold , unfavorable coronary venous anatomy with narrow and tortuous coronary sinus tributary ( coronary sinus tributary ) , phrenic nerve stimulation or pacing lead instability . 
management of superficial <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> without follicular involvement can be accomplished by total body application of topical 0.1 % tretinoin cream [16 ] . 
these necrotic changes were very severe and characterized as vascular necrosis in one pig and as an acute-subacute fibrinopurulent-necrotic <START:PHENOTYPE> peritonitis <END> in another one , which died at post infection day 14 . 
furthermore , mild focal mononuclear <START:PHENOTYPE> interstitial nephritis <END> was observed in four animals and a mild acute focal glomerulonephrosis was detected in two animals at post infection day 14 . 
this was the case when considering each coronary sinus tributary separately , or when dividing patients between " lateral " and " septal " sites , in the entire population and in the subgroups of patients without <START:PHENOTYPE> coronary artery disease <END> . 
a disease complex with chronic musculoskeletal signs , including stiffness and <START:PHENOTYPE> joint pain <END> , and to which there is a strong predisposition in the canine breed nova scotia duck tolling retriever ( tolling retriever ) has been recognized in sweden . 
these antibodies may be useful as a serological marker for <START:PHENOTYPE> thymoma <END> in younger patients . 
phorbol myristate acetate rescues ifn-gamma inducibility of major histocompatibility complex class ii in low responding ls1034 <START:PHENOTYPE> colon carcinoma <END> cell line we next attempted to restore ifn-gamma inducibility of major histocompatibility complex class ii in poorly responding tumor cell lines by adding protein kinase c agonist phorbol myristate acetate into culture medium containing variable concentrations of ifn-gamma . 
differential diagnosis precin the radiation fielddifferential diagnosis needs exclusion of some rare dermatological syndromes , such as bazex syndrome ( characterin the radiation field by basal-cell carcinoma associated with <START:PHENOTYPE> hypotrichosis <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> hypohidrosis <END> , most striking are small very transient keratin-filled cysts and folliculare atrophodermia) , trichoepithelioma papulosum multiplex ( named also epithelioma adenoin the radiation field cysticum) , or torre 's syndrome ( muir-torre 's syndrome ) . 
anterior subcapsular and <START:PHENOTYPE> cortical cataracts <END> occurred in most mice . 
ten to 44 % of the patients have nail involvement as well , ranging from <START:PHENOTYPE> longitudinal ridging <END> and thickening to friability and shedding [11 ,12 ] . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastomas <END> in gorlin syndrome usually have the desmoplastic phenotype , which has been linked , in some studies , with an improved prognosis [47 ] . 
the histologic features of <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> in gorlin syndrome are usually in the radiation fieldtical to those observed in sporadic <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> . 
the 2 diseases may together represent a canine equivalent of the human disease <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia areata <END> . 
the chang staging system is used to stage <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> in gorlin syndrome . 
our findings also suggest that symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and black hair follicular dysplasia in the gordon setter might be <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune diseases <END> that are pathogenetically related , which might indicate a common genetic predisposition . 
other antibodies antibodies against the intracellular skeletal muscle protein titin may be present in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> thymoma <END> , but they are also present in about half of patients with late-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis without thymoma [32 ,33 ] . 
in terms of their incidence , radicular cysts are the commonest ( mostly associated to teeth with pulp necrosis due to advanced <START:PHENOTYPE> dental caries <END> ) , followed by dentigerous and odontogenic keratocysts ( odontogenic keratocysts ) [12 ] . 
ryanodine antibodies are also associated with late-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
rarely , babies can have <START:PHENOTYPE> fibromas <END> in the heart : at least two cases have presented before 3 months of age with <START:PHENOTYPE> fibromas <END> [71 ,136 ] . 
patients with muscle-specific tyrosine kinase <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis are predominantly female and may exhibit prominent bulbar , neck , shoulder girdle , and respiratory <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> [1 ,2 ,4] . 
from post infection day 4 , all the remaining animals showed evidence of typical classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> lesions characterized by severe enlargement of lymph nodes with haemorrhages in the periphery , spleen infarction and petechial haemorrhages in the renal cortex . 
however , several laboratories offer commercial testing for gorlin syndrome and testing is certainly indicated in children with desmoplastic <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> , where radiation is contemplated . 
in one series , <START:PHENOTYPE> thymomas <END> were demonstrated in 60 % of patients with anti-striated muscle antibodies and <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis beginning before age 50 , and in less than 2% of patients without these antibodies [31 ] . 
muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies antibodies to muscle-specific tyrosine kinase have been demonstrated recently in about one third of patients with generalized seronegative <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
anti-striated muscle antibodies have been demonstrated in 80% of patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> thymoma <END> in the absence of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
reports of ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> and sudden death after ablation have raised concerns about safety . 
using primers flanking the coding exons of tropomodulin 2 we performed mutational analysis on <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> 5 patients . 
following <START:PHENOTYPE> thymoma <END> resection , a rise in anti-striated muscle antibody titer may suggest recurrent tumor [30] . 
nearly half of all patients enrolled had a non-ischemic etiology of <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> . 
iii the companion trial [46 ] is a study of resynchronization therapy with and without an implantable cardioverter defibrillator in patients with new york heart association class iii-iv <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> who had a hospitalization for <START:PHENOTYPE> heart failure <END> within the year prior to enrollment . 
in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , repetitive nerve stimulation study findings are abnormal when the amplitude of the fourth compound muscle action potential is reduced more than 10 % from the baseline value . 
in contrast to 1-antitrypsin , secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor blocks elastin-bound elastase in the alveolar walls , which might also protect against the development of <START:PHENOTYPE> emphysema <END> . 
contradictory results have been presented concerning the levels of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor during <START:PHENOTYPE> allergic rhinitis <END> in antigen-challenged atopic subjects . 
they are found in 30% of patients with adult-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , and they appear to be more common in patients with later disease onset [30] . 
this was a prospective , multicenter registry of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> patients undergoing atrioventricular node ablation and pacing . 
an indirect immunofluorescence-antinuclear antibodies ( <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibody <END> ) test and an assay for the presence of antibodies to anaplasma phagocytophilum and borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato were performed , as well as some haematology , serum biochemistry and urine tests . 
although rates of childhood <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> have remained low in china , common indoor air pollutants , coal and tobacco smoke , impair children 's respiratory health . 
for example , lower secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor levels were found in the bronchial secretions of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> patients . 
other studies indicated that levels of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor are also lower in nasal secretion of <START:PHENOTYPE> allergic rhinitis <END> patients compared to healthy controls . 
although the role for these antibodies in the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis has yet to be determined , they may have prognostic value and expedite chest imaging studies for detection of <START:PHENOTYPE> thymoma <END> . 
as patients with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome are especially sensitin the radiation fieldto ionizing radiation , the use of irradiation should be minimin the radiation field when possible . 
conclusion this paper describes a disorder in nova scotia duck tolling retrievers where the clinical signs , <START:PHENOTYPE> antinuclear antibodies <END> reactivity and response to corticosteroids strongly suggest that the disorder is immune-mediated . 
other testing chest computerized tomography ( computed tomography ) should be performed in patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis to exclude the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> thymoma <END> . 
kimonis et al . descrin the radiation field the radiologic findings that are most helpful in diagnosing nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome [46 ] . 
in children at risk , diagnosis can often be achieved by radiographic means ( calcification of falx , <START:PHENOTYPE> rib anomalies <END> , calcification of <START:PHENOTYPE> ovarian fibromas <END> ) . 
twenty-seven per cent of the dogs also showed <START:PHENOTYPE> muscle pain <END> and 18 % different skin symptoms . 
the appearance of two or more recidivant odontogenic keratocysts , or an early okc in a young subject , is suggestin the radiation fieldof nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome syndrome . 
summary pharmacologic testing with intravenous edrophonium is sensitive when performed in patients with significant <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> or external <START:PHENOTYPE> ophthalmoparesis <END> . repetitive nerve stimulation studies may demonstrate impaired neuromuscular transmission , especially when performed recording from clinically weak muscles , though they are relatively insensitive in ocular and in mild generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
sfe <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis is the most sensitive laboratory test for myasthenia gravis , although abnormal sfemyasthenia gravis findings may be seen in motor neuropathic and in myopathic disorders . 
at 3 years , the frequency of examinations could be reduced to once a year until 7 years of age , after which a <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> is very unlin the radiation fieldy . 
in experiment ii , classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus was detected at post infection day 4 in the tonsil and ileocoecal lymph node of one pig . 
normal sfe <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis findings in a clinically weak muscle exclude a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis . 
in order to detect a deficit related to a <START:PHENOTYPE> medulloblastoma <END> , a neurological examination is recommended every six months [5 ] . 
in experiment iii , classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus was isolated only from the tonsils of three animals at post infection days 3 , 5 and 7 and from the ileocoecal lymph node of one pig at post infection day 7 and mesenteric lymph node of one animal at post infection day 8 . 
in the clinical context of fluctuating and fatigable <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , acetylcholine receptor or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase antibodies confirm the diagnosis of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , though nearly half of patients with ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis are seronegative . 
in case of a family history of the din the radiation fieldse , at birth or immediately after , a detain the radiation field examination should look for the presence of a <START:PHENOTYPE> large head <END> , frontal and temporal bossing , <START:PHENOTYPE> cleft palate <END> [35 ] , eye anomalies and <START:PHENOTYPE> bifid ribs <END> [16 , 19] , or vertebral anomalies . 
iodinated contrast agents have rarely precipitated significant worsening of myasthenic <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> [35 ,36 ] . 
though this is an uncommon phenomenon [37] , we do not routinely use iodinated contrast agents during chest computed tomography studies performed to assess for <START:PHENOTYPE> thymoma <END> . 
rokas et al . evaluated the role of rr interval distribution pattern as an outcome predictor of radiofrequency modification of the atrioventricular node in chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> and the likely mechanism of rate control [49 ] . 
since <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis often co-exists with other <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disorders <END> , particularly autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid disease <END> , patients should undergo thyroid function testing along with testing for other autoimmune disorders when clinically appropriate . 
in these animals exon 3 and its splice acceptor were deleted , causing a rare intergenic transcript between prion and doppelto be highly upregulated and abnormally expressed in the brain , leading to late-onset <START:PHENOTYPE> ataxia <END> and purkinje cell degeneration . 
patients with high risk features for <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> such as <START:PHENOTYPE> congestive heart failure <END> or <START:PHENOTYPE> impaired left ventricular function <END> , may require pacing at higher rates . 
polymorphic ventricular <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmias <END> are related to electrical instability due to an initial prolongation and then slow adaptation of repolarization caused by change in the heart rate and activation sequence . 
to compare the safety and efficacy of the anterior versus the posterior approach for atrioventricular node modification , lee et al . randomly assigned 40 patients with medically refractory <START:PHENOTYPE> paroxysmal atrial fibrillation <END> to receive av junction modification with an anterior or posterior approach [48 ] . 
the superior cervical ganglion ( superior cervical ganglion ) has been suggested to be a peripheral neuroendocrine center because of the <START:PHENOTYPE> plethora <END> of tissues that receive adrenergic input from this source ( cardinali et al. , 1981 ) . 
patients with ryanodine antibodies may exhibit severe , treatment-resistant <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis associated with malignant <START:PHENOTYPE> thymomas <END> [34 ] . 
the pathological findings were usually acute or subacute fibrinous salpingitis , oophoritis and <START:PHENOTYPE> peritonitis <END> , or more infrequently <START:PHENOTYPE> pericarditis <END> , perihepatitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> pneumonia <END> and air sacculitis . 
in addition , other immune-mediated conditions , such as addison 's disease and aseptic <START:PHENOTYPE> meningitis <END> ( also called steroid-responsive meningitis-arteritis , srma) , have been reported to occur at a high frequency in the tolling retriever breed [1-3] . 
in human medicine , rheumatic diseases are <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disorders <END> where the clinical problems involve joints , soft tissues and allied conditions of connective tissues . 
other concomitant findings , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> and skin problems , are unusual but may be apparent . 
smn , encoding survival of motor neuron 2 , downregulated by c2 analog of ceramide , strongly contributes to the severity of the <START:PHENOTYPE> spinal muscular atrophy <END> . 
in addition , acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy ( acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy ) and variants of acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy affecting cranial muscles such as the miller-fisher and cervical-brachial-pharyngeal variants may simulate <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , though the <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> does not have the same variability . 
mitochondrial neuromuscular disorders , particularly those featuring <START:PHENOTYPE> external ophthalmoplegia <END> and <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> , may simulate <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
differential diagnosis differential diagnosis includes other disorders of the neuromuscular junction including lambert eaton syndrome , botulism , congenital myasthenic syndromes , and tick <START:PHENOTYPE> paralysis <END> . 
finally , brainstem ischemia may simulate the fluctuating character of <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , though unlike <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , consciousness , balance and coordination , and sensation are often impaired . 
the sensitivity of edrophonium testing has been estimated to be about 86 % for ocular <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis and 95 % for generalized <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis [15 ] . 
management treatment must be individualized to each patient with <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
however , the onset of symptoms is gradual , and the <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> does not fluctuate greatly . 
therefore , edrophonium testing is most useful in patients who have significant <START:PHENOTYPE> ptosis <END> or restricted extraocular movements that can be graded objectively . 
hence , they proposed that their presence denotes possible sources or substrate for <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial arrhythmia <END> . 
genetic variants might contribute to the variation in numbers of <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinomas <END> and jaw cysts observed in nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome families [137 ] . 
motor neuron disease involving oropharyngeal <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> may appear similar to <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , though the presence of corticobulbar features and increased fiber density measurements on sfemyasthenia gravis can assist in distinguishing these entities . 
factors to be considered in selecting treatment include the distribution , duration , and severity of myasthenic <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> and functional impairment , the risk for treatment complications related to medical comorbidities , age , and gender , and the ability of the patient to obtain medication and comply with drug dosing schedules and toxicity monitoring . 
the monoclonal antibody , specific to gp e2 of classical swine <START:PHENOTYPE> fever <END> virus , gave specific positive cytoplasmic staining reaction in tonsils , spleen , lymph nodes , lungs and kidneys but not in myocardium and striated muscles . 
background <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> ) , or <START:PHENOTYPE> dyslexia <END> , is a common syndrome with a significant genetic component . 
conclusions in total , five possible candidate genes for <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> and other diseases mapping to this region were identified . 
few treatments have been subjected to rigorous , prospective , placebo-controlled study in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
recently fujiin the radiation field al . used newly designed high-resolution oligonucleotin the radiation fieldmicroarrays with a median distance between the probes of 776 bp ( average probe interval 2,271 bp ) to detect gene deletions in nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome patients . 
gerlis et al . reported two cases of ventricular pre-excitation due to accessory pathways histologically identified as being associated with coronary sinus <START:PHENOTYPE> aneurysms <END> [40 ] . 
development of increased <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> may also suggest abnormal neuromuscular transmission . 
there also remains the question of reversibility of electrophysiological changes in the atrium induced by <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> ( electrical remodeling ) . 
while <START:PHENOTYPE> thymoma <END> resection is necessary to prevent compromise of mediastinal structures , the benefit of thymectomy for patients with non-thymomatous <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis remains uncertain . 
it is unknown up to what time point in the natural history of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> those changes are still reversible and the patient can be helped by removal of the initiating trigger . 
patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis should undergo chest computed tomography ( computed tomography ) to exclude the presence of <START:PHENOTYPE> thymoma <END> . 
the coronary sinus has also been suggested to have a role in the origin and sustenance of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> . 
in addition to the exon iii polymorphism , barr and colleaguesexamined the distributions of a 12 0-bp repeat 1.2 kilobases upstream to the transcription start site and a single nucleotide polymorphism (single nucleotide polymorphism ) defined by a c to t substitution at position -521 in attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder populations . 
for that reason , we questioned whether phorbol myristate acetate could produce similar changes in ls1034 <START:PHENOTYPE> colon carcinoma <END> cells . 
recently , a formal meta analysiswas conducted on the growing body of literature of this drd4 polymorphism and its association with attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder . 
based on 7 case control studies ( 4 positive ) and 14 family-based studies ( 9 positive) , the meta analysis concluded that a " ...statistically significant association between attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder and the 7- repeat allele of drd4 " existed , with a relative risk of 1 .9 for 7 case-control studies and 1.4 for 14 family-based studies . 
the prevalence was higher in patients with patrial fibrillation than in subjects with other or no <START:PHENOTYPE> arrhythmia <END> . 
the question arises whether symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> and black hair follicular dysplasia in the gordon setter are signs or results of the same disease mechanism . 
this work functionally demonstrates that bmp4 is a good candidate to cause human anterior segment dysgenesis and developmental <START:PHENOTYPE> glaucoma <END> . 
the offspring of an individual with mild nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome caused by somatic mosaicism may have a risk of less than 5 0 % of inheriting the din the radiation fieldse-causing mutation . 
the difference observed in our material was that inflammatory reactions seen in symmetrical lupoid <START:PHENOTYPE> onychodystrophy <END> were not present in black hair follicular dysplasia . 
in general , the increased risks related to long-term immune modulation become more acceptable in more severe <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis to offset increased morbidity and mortality related to uncontrolled disease . 
expression of the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> protein is not lost in ls1034 , msto-211h and hepg2 cell lines a substantial percentage of human tumors lose the expression of the <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein ( <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein) , important as a necessary condition for ifn-gamma-mediated induction of major histocompatibility complex class ii . 
until more thorough examinations are performed we would like to point out common features like degenerative and dysplastic changes in the epidermal basal cells and follicular cells , and pigmentary <START:PHENOTYPE> incontinence <END> in the dermis . 
a detailed review of treatment issues in autoimmune <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis may be found elsewhere [38 ] . 
therefore , we wished to determine whether the poor ifn-gamma inducibility of major histocompatibility complex class ii in ls1034 , msto-211h and hepg2 cell lines could be explained by the loss of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein . 
a few mice had <START:PHENOTYPE> anterior subcapsular cataracts <END> . 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors acetylcholinesterase inhibitors slow the hydrolysis of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction and provide temporary improvement in strength in many patients with <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
immunofluorescent staining with a <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein-specific mab ( clone g3-245 ) demonstrated that all cell lines tested expressed <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein ( figure 5 ) . 
although acetylcholinesterase inhibitors were among the earliest and remain one of the most widely prescribed treatments for <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis , there are no controlled clinical trials of these agents in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis . 
a closer look at figure 5reveals that the 4 cell lines can be ranked according to their <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein contents in the following order : sw480 > ls1034 > msto-211h > hepg2 . 
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are a symptomatic therapy for <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis and do not retard the underlying autoimmune attack on the neuromuscular junction . 
the roles for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in <START:PHENOTYPE> myasthenia <END> gravis include treatment of ocular and mild generalized disease , treatment in patients who cannot receive immune suppression , and adjunctive treatment for patients receiving immunotherapy with residual or refractory myasthenic <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> . 
the pacemaker may be single chamber ( vvi ) for chronic <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> or dual chamber (ddd ) for <START:PHENOTYPE> paroxysmal atrial fibrillation <END> . 
effective dosing of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors reduces myasthenic <START:PHENOTYPE> weakness <END> , minimizes muscarinic medication side effects , and must be individualized to each patient 's distribution of weakness and diurnal symptom fluctuation . 
for example , patients with prominent <START:PHENOTYPE> dysphagia <END> may benefit by taking pyridostigmine 30 minutes before meals and those with more symptoms in the afternoon and evening may shift their dosing to later in the day to better target symptoms . 
individuals with reduced anti-proteinase activity as a result of alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency , have an increased propensity to develop <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> . 
the risk to family members is various , about 70 80% of individuals diagnosed with nevoid <START:PHENOTYPE> basal cell carcinoma <END> syndrome have an affected parent and about 20 30% of probands have a de novo mutation . 
we recently constructed a bac/pac contig of the 6p <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> locusand identified the precise location and order of 29 short tandem repeat ( short tandem repeat ) markers spanning this region . 
palliative radiofrequency procedures for <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> permanent <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> is usually not amenable to ablation procedures and may require multiple pharmacological agents for management . 
studies looking at polymorphisms in drd4 and infant attentionas well as disorders such as <START:PHENOTYPE> obsessive compulsive disorder <END> , tourette syndromeand schizophreniaas well as underlying dimensions of novelty seeking , attachmentand temperament have also shown associations . 
oxidative stress may play an important role in the pathogenesis of smoking-associated diseases , such as <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases <END> ( <START:PHENOTYPE> chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases <END> ) , <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , and carcinogenesis . 
genetic linkage studies have identified five potential <START:PHENOTYPE> reading disability <END> loci located on chromosomes 1 , 2 , 6 , 15and 18 . 
polymeropoulos et al recently reported a 66-year-old woman with a history of typical atrial flutter and <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> in whom endocardial recordings during <START:PHENOTYPE> tachycardia <END> from this region showed a discrete electrical potential ( marshall potential ) preceding the atrial electrogram [43 ] . 
mutational analysis of tropomodulin 2 for <START:PHENOTYPE> amyotrophic lateral sclerosis <END> 5 and tropomodulin 4 for limb girdle <START:PHENOTYPE> muscular dystrophy <END> 1b the coding exons of tropomodulin 2 and tropomodulin 4 were amplified from patient lymphoblast genomic dna using primers flanking the exon ( table 2 ) . 
because of the potential for serious muscarinic side effects including bronchospasm and <START:PHENOTYPE> bradycardia <END> , atropine should be readily available . 
allergic inflammation , including rhinitis , <START:PHENOTYPE> asthma <END> , anaphylaxis and <START:PHENOTYPE> urticaria <END> are all disorders associated with mast cell activation . 
the ligament of marshall is another focus of <START:PHENOTYPE> atrial fibrillation <END> that has been described in the literature . 
typical muscarinic side effects include <START:PHENOTYPE> increased sweating <END> , lacrimation , salivation , <START:PHENOTYPE> nausea <END> , and <START:PHENOTYPE> diarrhea <END> . 
cooksummarized the results of an additional 11 family-based studies in a meta analysis and concluded that the association between the dat gene and attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder was highly significant ( p < .0001 ) . 
this ranking would be valid only if fluorescence intensity correlates closely with the absolute contents of <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein protein per cell . 
associations with other disorders including , <START:PHENOTYPE> bipolar disorder <END> , alcoholismand temperamental dimensions have been found . 
it is important to note that certain mutations greatly reduce transport of newly synthesized <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein molecules into the nucleus where <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein performs its function . 
for example , the number of epitopes recognized by g3-245 mab may be reduced if tumor cells express viral oncoproteins that bind and inactivate <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein . 
the cutaneous affections described here have many features in common with the human skin disease <START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia areata <END> which has a peak incidence in children and young adults .

mast cell and leukocyte serine proteinases are shown to be elevated in the airways of <START:PHENOTYPE> asthmatic <END> patients . 
<START:PHENOTYPE> alopecia areata <END> has a genetic predisposition , is supposed to be an <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune disease <END> mediated by t cells , and is associated to other <START:PHENOTYPE> autoimmune diseases <END> like <START:PHENOTYPE> vitiligo <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> thyroid disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> addison disease <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> diabetes mellitus <END> , pernicious <START:PHENOTYPE> anemia <END> , <START:PHENOTYPE> ulcerative colitis <END> and sle . 
attention-deficit/ <START:PHENOTYPE> hyperactivity <END> disorder patients have also been found to show higher levels of dat1 in the striatum . 
as the flow cytometry protocol does not allow us to discriminate between cytoplasmic and nuclear staining , the question about the presence of functional <START:PHENOTYPE> retinoblastoma <END> tumor suppressor protein protein in the examined cell lines remains open .
